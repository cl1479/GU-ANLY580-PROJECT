0,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What exactly is Obamacare and what did it change?,I understand what medicare is and everything but I'm not sure what Obamacare changed.
1,explainlikeimfive,ELI5 has defaulted!,"We were informed yesterday by the reddit admins that they had selected ELI5 to be a default! This is incredibly exciting, and it means that we are about to experience some real changes. However, despite the changes (which I'll mention below), we will still continue to stay true to the ELI5 community.

Before I proceed, I'd like to just say how humbled I am to be a part of such a great community that is now a default sub! I think I speak for all the mods and faithful subscribers when I say that it is quite frankly unbelievable.

***

**Changes**

1. **We will be inundated with new users.** They will not understand how ELI5 works. It is the responsibility of all of us who know that ELI5 is for *layman-friendly explanations and questions that prompt those explanations* to spread that message to the newcomers. We will work on enhancing the sidebar both contentwise and aesthetically to make it easier to understand.

2. **Moderation may be a bit stricter.** We will have many more trolls and spammers. Please use that report button, and message the mods using the sidebar link with a link to anything you see! Expect reposts for a little while, and just learn to deal with them. If it's something that's been asked once or twice recently, then let us know and we'll handle it. But if it's a question that was asked a few months ago, just move on or link OP to a good explanation from the past.

3. **We will be adding more moderators.** ***DO NOT APPLY TO BE A MODERATOR IN THIS THREAD.*** It's a long, pain-in-the-ass process that likely won't even be open, so please do not inquire about it. In all likelihood, we will approach users who have and continue to 1) report spam to us via modmail and 2) post quality content on the subreddit. One of those moderators will be automoderator.

***

As always, thanks to all of you who visit, or who even subscribed voluntarily! And welcome to everyone new.

For the other mods,

3,explainlikeimfive,"ELI67 Please explain like I'm 67 the difference between email, Google, Aol, a website, IE, Chrome, and the internet.","I know this kind of breaks the rules, but I think a good explanation would be whats Reddit is all about. I have always had real trouble explaining this to my older relatives and computer illiterate friends. 


Edit: thanks to everyone for all of your answers. 
"
4,explainlikeimfive,"[META] Okay, this sub is slowly turning into /r/answers.","Questions here are supposed to be covering complex topics that are difficult to understand, where simplifying the answer for a layperson is necessary.

So why are we flooding the sub with simple knowledge questions? This sub is for explaining the Higgs Boson or the effect of black holes on the passage of time, not telling why we say ""shotgun"" when we want the passenger seat in a car.

**EDIT:** Alright, I thought my example would have been sufficient, but it's clear that I need to explain a little.

My problem is that questions are being asked where **there is no difference between an expert answer and a layman answer.** In keeping with the shotgun example, that holds true-- People call the front passenger seat by saying 'shotgun' because, in the ages of horses and carts, the person sitting next to the one driving the horses was the one armed to protect the wagon. There is no way for that explanation to be any more simple or complex than it already is. Thus, it has no reason to be in a sub built around a certain kind of answer in contrast to another."
5,explainlikeimfive,"For ELI5 comments, could we possibly adopt r/science's policy of no joke answers being tolerated?","http://i.imgur.com/ZApmv.png

I enjoy a good laugh, don't mean to be a grinch! It's just a bit inconvenient when one is trying to find the answer to said question and has to trudge through a thread about sexually-efficient Germans (for example). "
7,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: WTF was the Architect was trying to tell Neo in the movie Matrix?,"Like seriously, I've been watching this movie on and on... and still don't get that part! What is it about Choice and the Matrix? What did the Oracle figure about humanity that made them believe in the Matrix as their reality? I'd be so thankful to anyone who can put this Philosophy in simple English. 



Edit: Thank you everyone! So far there have been 5 attempts to answer the question, What i thought would be a casual discussion of movie fanatics has become a great intro to Philosophy! Wow i reading all the threads and i'd **highly recommend** everybody interested in the movie to do so. It bought me a whole new perspective to the movie. 



Questions Unanswered so far or raised in the discussion: 


1. Neo's real world super powers, stopping the sentinels and vision without eyes. 



2. Agent Smith's rejection of matrix and connection with Neo.



3. The Oracles true personality. 



4. Why were the machines using humans instead of geothermal (Magma) energy while Zion found itself comfortable to do so? "

13,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why aren't people buying the $1 houses in Detroit?,"I know there's no jobs in Detroit and nobody wants to live there, but surely there has to be some value to having a house there right? Even for the slight chance that property houses might rise in the next 100 years?

Houses like this one: http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/4700-Saint-Clair-St-Detroit-MI-48214/88410305_zpid/"
14,explainlikeimfive,ELI5:How can Netflix put all kinds of cool TV shows online for less than $10/month with no commercials when cable companies charge people $75/month or more and you do have to watch commercials?,"Plus with Netflix I can watch whatever I want instead of what someone else put on. I don't get how the economics work?
Is cable a giant rip off, or is Netflix spending investors money which will eventually run out?

Edit: I didn't realize that the shows on Netflix aren't new. I'm just thrilled they have Star Trek and the PowerPuff Girls which is all I would watch if I had cable.

Also, for those who are saying ""Don't forget to factor in the cost of internet"", my response is that I had broadband internet a long time before Netflix even existed - a long time before you could even watch TV on a computer in any practical way. So, saying I should factor in something I have anyway is, to me, like saying I should factor in the cost of electricity."
15,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does Coca-cola still advertise?,"Why do companies that have seemingly maxed out on brand recognition still spend so much money on advertising?  There is not a person watching TV who doesn't know about Pepsi/Coke. So it occurs to me that they cannot increase the awareness of their product or bring new customers to the product. Without creating new customers, isn't advertisement a waste of money? 


I understand that they need to advertise new products, but oftentimes, it's not a new product featured in a TV commercial.

The big soda companies are the best example I can think of.

**Edit:** Answered. Thanks everyone!

**Edit 2:** Thanks again to everybody for the discussions! I learned **alot** more than I expected. If we weren't all strangers on the internet, I'd buy everyone a Pepsi."
16,explainlikeimfive,This belongs in /r/answers,"Or, /r/askscience. Or on google.

90% of the time I see this comment, it doesn't, and for a few reasons.

1. Pretty much every ""superficial"" topic or question can spawn deep conversation.

2. For /r/askscience, there's a reason people don't always post there. If they want a simple answer to a science question, ELI5 is a great place.

3. ""Google it."" Why? Just because there's information to be found doesn't mean OP necessarily knows what to read or believe. A lot of times, there are cultural differences or other reasons OP is posting here. Do you people seriously think it's lazy to type up a post here rather than look it up? I didn't realize attempting to become informed on an issue was considered ""lazy.""

4. **It's not about OP.** The beauty of ELI5 is that, while OP gets his/her question answered, the subscribers see (and contribute to) discussions about topics *they would never think to even ask*. That is what makes this subreddit great.

So please, cut it out with the ""this belongs in /r/answers"" comments. **If you *really* think it does, report the post and message the mods with a link to it and your reasoning. And please, don't abuse that.**

17,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Which African countries play the most important roles on the continent? Which countries should everyone know a brief overview of?,"I mean, imagine you were describing the US to someone who were only vaguely aware of what it was.  You would start by talking about New York and California, maybe say a few things about Chicago and Florida and New Orleans and the deep south, but you wouldn't mention South Dakota.  That's what I'm looking for here, just a few succinct sentences about the more important countries/cities/areas.

 Like, I know Nigeria is the biggest in terms of population and is considered an important up-and-coming economy due in part to oil revenues, but mired in conflict by the North/South religious divide, scandal and corruption, all of which threatens to tear the country apart.


And please don't say ""all the countries are important,"" because like States, that's not true.  That's not to say they don't have value, but I mean more in terms of continental (or global) social/political/economic issues.


Edit: Thanks for the answers, very informative."
18,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Who was Aaron Swartz and what is the controversy over his suicide?,"This question is asked out of respect and me trying to gain knowledge on the happenings of his life and death.

19,explainlikeimfive,Can someone describe the debt ceiling to me (Like I'm Five?),"This is basically the question that started me on this subreddit. Anywhere I look to get it explained to me, it's still kind of confusing. I keep hearing that this is the first time raising the debt limit has been such a big deal. Why is this the case?

25,explainlikeimfive,ELI5:Why is fraud a crime but being a 'psychic' not a crime,"I know that people can't get everything right all the time but isn't it probable that a lot of people advertising as psychics or fortune tellers are just scamming others?

EDIT: ok so i guess to sum it all up, being a 'psychic' or a 'reader' isn't technically fraud in most place because the small print, informing people that it's only for entertainment purposes, covers their asses in a legal sense. Whether you think this is ethical or not, is entirely up to you but thanks to everyone who contributed :)"
27,explainlikeimfive,ELI5:How is it possible that almost every country in the world is in debt? Wouldn't that just mean that there is not enough money in the world?,"It seems like the numbers just don't add up if every country owes every other country.

Edit: What I'm trying to get at is that if Country A has, say, $-10, as well as Countries B and C because they are all in debt, then the world has $-30, which seems impossible, so who has the $30?

Edit 2: Thanks for all the responses (and the front page)! Really clears things up for me. Trying to read through all the responses because apparently there is not nearly as concrete of an answer as I thought there would be. Also, if anyone isn't satisfied by the top answers, dig a little deeper. There are some quality explanations that have been buried.

Edit 3: I think that a lot of you are over-complicating this question. Although the history and logistics of economics is really interesting and I have learned a lot about it from your responses, I feel like there is a lot of unnecessary information here. Here are the responses that I feel like answer this question best. It may be that none of these are right and it may be that all of them are (it seems like the answer to this question is a combination of things), but here are the top 3 answers (sorry if this oversimplifies things):

1)	Even though all of the governments are in debt, they are all in debt to each other, so the money works out. If they were all to somehow simultaneously pay each other back, the money would hypothetically even out, but this is both impossible and impractical.

2)	Money is actually created through inflation and interest, so there is more money on earth that there is value because interest creates money out of nowhere. 

3)	For the most part, countries do not owe each other but their citizens and various banks. So the banks and people have the money and the government itself is in debt. Therefore, every country’s government can be in debt because they owe the banks, which are in surplus.

39,explainlikeimfive,"Thoughts on ELI5. (We can, and should, do better than this)","When I first subscribed to this subreddit, it was awesome. I saw complex theories and practices written with wit and intelligence in a simple and concise manner. 

If you look at the front page now, there are really not too many posts that require the lens of a 5 year old. Rather, they are simple questions that require simple answers. They are not logically complex questions, that would require a simplified solution for the layman. 

Some examples:
Hello i'm from Argentina, can someone explain why a black guy eating a watermelon is racist?

ELI5: How Apple can publicly claim iPhone 5 is the thinnest smartphone in the world?

ELI5: Why can places like Newegg ship UPS for free when it costs regular people so much money?

ELI5: The Obama Birther Issue

Explain like I'm 5 why the states with the highest average income, health metrics, and education levels are also the most liberal and nobody ever talks about it.


Do these type of questions benefit from being described to a 5 year old? These are questions with pretty straightforward answers, and while they may not be suitable for a child, I think it's a waste of real estate in this subreddit when these questions would be much better directed in appropriate /r/ask subreddits. 

I would think we should be seeing more posts like ""Why do we stretch and why does it feel good when we do?""

The actual answer probably requires some biology and science knowledge of anatomy, and benefits from having it's explanation suited for 5 year old. 

Also - if you check the number of ""Answered"" in this subreddit, it's not a high percentage. I think this because the questions are not worthy of a ELI5 explanation.

I think we need to have more ""big issue"" posts, topic posts. EG - ELI5 - The Housing Bubble... or ELI5 Computer Languages

Check this out:
http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j86h2/the_fiveyearolds_guide_to_the_galaxy/

This subreddit should be an ever-expanding version of this, right? Instead, we are bloated with a ton of posts that don't require ELI5, and it's ruining the creativity and unique edge this subreddit used to have.


Can we band together and downvote questions that don't really require ELI5 and upvote ones that would make for an engaging answer?
I hope so. 

Don't mean to come off negatively, I just want to see this subreddit return to domincance as an intriguing and enlightening subreddit. Not one filled with questions that probably belong in /r/politics or /r/technology or most appropriately /r/askreddit. 

But maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. 

Thanks. "

Of course this isn't an issue that can be answered in black and white, but your answers, thoughts, and opinions have helped me understand a lot of variables and issues that may cause a President to change their stance.

45,explainlikeimfive,[meta] A friendly reminder,"Hey everyone!

We'd just like to remind ELI5 that this is *explain to a layman*, **not** explain *to* a five-year-old. Some people like to address OP as ""little Johnny"" or overtly say things like ""when you're old enough"" or ""ask your mommy.""

We get that this is called explain like im five. And the answers are great. But while some people find it amusing or cute, to be honest it gets stale really quick and to many is very patronizing. We all know that the people here aren't actually five-- when they are OP usually says ""from my five year old!"" We're not into roleplaying here.

To be clear: we won't be removing these explanations. We're not in the business of needless censorship and we don't want to remove otherwise great explanations. Just please refrain from these posts. Nobody posts a legitimate question here because they want to be talked down to. Just answer the question as if OP is not an expert in the field but has a basic understanding of logic and basic things. Generally you can tell by the question where to start. If OP asks about what molecules are, you'd start with the basics of atoms and matter. But if they ask about the half life of uranium, you don't need to start describing that atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons, and that they're very small.

Thanks everyone, and keep up the great responses!"
46,explainlikeimfive,[Meta] I think people are forgetting what /r/explainlikeimfive is for.,"It used to be just a minor annoyance but now it's getting to the point where about 75% of all ELI5 posts reaching the front page are better suited to be on [/r/askreddit](/r/askreddit) or /r/answers, or sometimes even [/r/askscience](/r/askscience). Seeing how [/r/explainlikeimfive](/r/explainlikeimfive) has recently reached 100k readers, I think it's time to address this issue.

It seems like people are taking advantage of ELI5 more laid-back attitude and small-yet-noticeable subscription count to post questions that would never see the light of day on other subreddit. This subreddit's purpose is to be, as the sidebar states:

&gt;A friendly place to ask questions and get elementary school-level answers, without fear of judgement.

Take note of what kind of posts used to reach ELI5's front page during its early days:

* [Why is x^0 = 1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j8wmr/eli5_why_is_x01/)

* [How do Trust Funds actually work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j7nxt/explain_to_me_how_trust_funds_actually_work/)

* [How does HTTP work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j393m/can_someone_explain_http_like_im_five/)

* [What is fire and how does it work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j4xq2/what_is_fire_and_how_does_it_work/)

###Notice how each of these posts is a **complex subject or question**, and how many of the comment ***literally* make the answer simple enough for a five year old to understand**.

Now let's take a look at what has reached the ELI5 front page over the last week:

* [Why doesn't Reddit simply hire the guy who makes Reddit Enhancement Suite \(RES\) and make those features part of Reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s4iun/eli5_why_doesnt_reddit_simply_hire_the_guy_who/)

* [How is downloading movies/books online any different than going to your local library to check out movies/books for free?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s0rih/eli5_how_is_downloading_moviesbooks_online_any/)

* [Why some of my friends think Che Guevera is a hero, and others say he is a bad dude?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s2a2k/eli5_why_some_of_my_friends_think_che_guevera_is/)

* [Why do British people sound American when they sing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/rxybc/eli5_why_do_british_people_sound_american_when/)

### None of these posts is complex nor addresses anything that requires explaining. Much of the posts are suggestive or simply provocative, and ALL of them would fit better in other subreddits. The answers to these posts are never fit for 5 year olds, and are no different from [/r/Askreddit](/r/Askreddit) answers.

The subreddit has lost its way.

I understand that the admins here want to make the community in charge of what reaches the front page and what gets filtered out, but sometimes forced, strict moderating is what you have to do. 

No need to go all the way into the no-memes-or-any-kind-of-fun zone where [/r/askscience](/r/askscience) lies, but letting stagnation, new redditors and circlejerkers take over isn't the answer either (See [/r/atheism](/r/atheism), [/r/classicrage](/r/classicrage), /r/gaming or what [/r/circlejerk](/r/circlejerk) used to be a mere month ago).

So please admins, if this post tries to say anything is that you should have stricter rules about which submissions should and should not go on [/r/explainlikeimfive](/r/explainlikeimfive). Be a little bit more delete-happy, and try to make the subreddit more like [the great video found in the sidebar.](http://vimeo.com/27060669)"

58,explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: If i'm programmed by evolution to be productive, why do I have such an incredible desire to be lazy (and then regret it)?","I think it would be a safe assumption that being a productive, hard working individual is advantageous from an evolutionary perspective. You can tell we are programmed as such since after a hard workout at the gym or nailing a big presentation at work our brain's reward system tells us we did a good job and releases endorphins/dopamine/whatever. That being said...why do I have no other desire than to lounge around with a pizza and a blanket and watch Netflix all day? And isn't it interesting that when you do that, later on you typically feel bad about the fact that you weren't productive and sat on your ass all day?

Busting my ass and doing great things gives me such greater pleasure than being lazy, but being lazy always seems like a much better option than busting my ass. Scumbag brain.

EDIT: Look I understand that biologically we are wired to conserve energy...but that doesn't explain the cognitive dissonance in my brain where it tells me to be lazy but at the same time beats me up for doing so.

EDIT 2: I think all i've learned from this debate is that I have a fundamentally flawed understanding of evolution. Hahaha

EDIT 3: And the lightbulb finally went off. I get what everyone is saying now I think. So if i'm understanding everything right, the means to propagating our genes ARE hard coded into our DNA, but that hard coding tells us to be lazy as a result of millions of years of evolution as opposed to few thousands of years of living in civilized society that probably had little to no effect on our genetic makeup.

I think what I was trying to say was that evolution has been favorable to those who are adaptable, and those who can adapt to our current society the best will reap the most rewards, allowing most potential to propagate our genes.

I hope that made sense...i'm thoroughly confused now and my brain hurts."

111,explainlikeimfive,ELI5 is not the only place to get answers.,"Hi. I've noticed that a lot of posts don't necessarily have to be posted here. I'm not taking ELI5 very literally, so I don't think answers have to make sense to a *five* year old, but just have to be simple in general. 

A lot of questions I see here don't need to be answered like someone's five. Answers that anybody might give would be simple enough without asking here for further simplifications. For example, Dolan. It's a sick twist on Disney comics. There. Was that so hard? I'm sure you would have gotten that answer on r/Answers or r/AskReddit had you not asked here.

People put the ELI5 tag without realizing its significance. Let's start with the word 'explain'. Explaining is not the same thing as answering. Explaining is taking something and making it simple. Answering is not necessarily the same thing. It's giving a response to an answer, and it's up to the answerer to see if that answer is simple or not.

There are a lot of good subreddits out there that you really need to check out.

If you want scientific answers, go to r/AskScience. People there are more knowledgeable in science. If you don't understand their answer, ask them to simplify it. I'm sure that they'd be willing to do that.

Also, please use the resources available to you. If you need help on a homework, your teachers, professors, or TA are your best sources for help. Also, a lot of the stuff you ask are far too broad to be answered here. For example, someone asked the history of Russia from 1990 on. You really can't explain that here. That would at least take a chapter from a good sized book.

When you bring an already correct answer it makes it much easier to figure out what level of understanding you are seeking It also helps to make sure you are getting the answer to a question that you had *intended* to ask and not just the question as you phrased it. 

**EDIT:** I like the suggestion of not downvoting correct responses. In order to effectively explain a concept to someone else you need two things. 

(1) Correct answers to begin with.  
(2) Great explanations of those correct answers.

So I would not initially up vote a correct answer, but if it leads to a great explanation, then I would go back and up vote the parent to make sure the pair, a correct answer and a great explanation, rise to the top.    

**EDIT 2:** Imagine you are reading a textbook or assignment on say mitosis and the material you are supposed to be learning is hard to understand. Instead of just posting ""What is mitosis"" you post ""can someone help me with this explanation of mitosis?"" You will be more able to get an explanation you understand that covers the material you are supposed to be reading about.

192,explainlikeimfive,A quick announcement on the direction of this subreddit.,"*“If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough”*  
– Albert Einstein

----

As I'm sure you already know, this subreddit is by far the quickest-growing in reddit's history, and is already in the top 100 on the entire site.  However, with our rapidly growing size we'll need to be extra careful that we head in the right direction.

**Most importantly, remember the name of the subreddit.** This is for legitimately elementary school-level explanations. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2epj/could_someone_please_explain_wikileaks/c28lbyd) is a wonderful example. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j350s/can_you_explain_the_difference_between_a/c28qks2), on the other hand, is something we should steer clear of (no offense to Nebula42; it's very informative but you'd be hard-pressed to find a five-year-old who can understand it).  Some topics are very difficult to explain on a low level, but keep in mind the Einstein quote above.

**Our other policies will be opened now for public discussion.** We want to create an environment of friendly collaboration, so instead of making unilateral decisions we're going to propose a number of options for this /r/ and see what the popular opinion is.

 * **The ability to mark your question as answered.** If we implement this, by responding to a post with some keyphrase (""thank you"" or something similar) you will trigger a CSS bot to mark your post with a check, letting other users know immediately that the post has been answered. *To ensure that we stay on an elementary school level, you would only mark an answer as sufficient if you really and truly believe it is simple enough for an elementary school student.* Alternatively, we could have a panel of mods decide if an answer is good and apply checks accordingly.  Discuss.

 * **A way to distinguish between actual questions and other posts.** Administrative posts, suggestions for the /r/, and other submissions not actually looking for an explanation could be somehow distinguished (I suggest by having the link color of non-question posts be faded). This would require having a keyword (LI5 or ELI5) in the question posts so they are easily distinguished.  This also means users will be forced to use LI5 or ELI5 or their post will be miscategorized. Discuss.

 * **User tags for users who consistently give good answers.**  Similar to something r/askscience has, we'd like to give tags to users who repeatedly give educated and, more importantly, *simple* explanations of complicated topics.  The how, when, and what are less clear.  Discuss.

 * **Removing comments which add nothing.**  I would personally like to see fewer comments like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2epj/could_someone_please_explain_wikileaks/c28mfg2) in this subreddit. I feel it clogs threads and takes focus away from responders who have something to add (like [this response to the same parent comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2epj/could_someone_please_explain_wikileaks/c28ng44)).  I would support reporting/removing comments which add nothing, but again – this thread is for public discussion of policies.

We hope this subreddit will continue to grow in a positive and fruitful direction, and we can't do it without your help in guiding it.  Please discuss any of the above topics in the comment section!

194,explainlikeimfive,"What exactly are muscle knots? I assume they form under stress, but why do they stay formed for long periods of time? ","**Edit:** I'm sorry I didn't follow the posting guidelines. The title should have read as follows: ELI5 - What exactly are muscle knots? I assume they form under stress, but why do they stay formed for long periods of time? 

**Edit 2:** Thank all of you for your responses and answers!! For some reason, the most highly voted answer has been deleted. I pasted a copy of that text below. **(Shout out to chaveza94!)**

**From chaveza94 -** This is what the top comment that has now been deleted said: ""Muscle knots are tiny automatic splints that form in muscles where you have tears. Here's what's going on. Your muscles (with the exception of your tongue), can only do two things: contract, and stop contracting. When you move your arm, the muscle contracts, when you move it back the muscle that moved it first stops resisting, and lets the other muscle move it back. When one of your muscles is damaged and gets a tiny tear in it, it tries to keep the tear from getting worse by clenching down around the tear. The muscle stays like that until the tear is healed (usually takes a day or two, muscles heal extremely fast). Well... Now we have a problem... Remember how your muscles can only contract? Well... now you have that splint clenched as hard as it can, and it's stopped contracting, but we have become a lazy and indolent species, and while normally our natural movement would cause the splint to be relaxed out, now it stays... and hurts. We call these knots, because they feel like knots tied in a rope. Knots! Have very little to do with stress... But there is another kind of nasty muscle pain that is often misrepresented as a ""knot"". This is the Fascial Adhesion. If you are under stress, this is probably what you are feeling. Here's what happens... All of your body is covered in a thin sheath of material called Fascia, every cell, is covered in it, it's what gives you your shape. Well muscle fibers covered in the stuff move within it back and forth. In places where your body doesn't need to move the muscle, so much as have it remain in place and strong, the fibers die out and the fascia bonds together. This happens normally, and it results in a tendon. This is perfectly normal... up to a point. When you are stressed you have a tendency to bunch up muscles and keep them that way. After a while the muscle fibers throw in the towel, and signal to the body that they are not really a muscle (biologically expensive) and could be replaced by a tendon (biologically inexpensive), and the fascia starts to bond together. This causes ""muscle tightness"" and frankly, hurts. If you get a massage and it hurts like someone took a hot knife through your muscles? It's the Fascial Adhesion breaking apart. Solution: To both knots and fascial adhesions are the same. Get a massage to deal with the knots and adhesions you have now, and move more to keep from getting them again. Seriously. Yoga.

195,explainlikeimfive,[ELI5] Why do American wall plates for switches use Flathead screws instead of Philips? Why do we use Flathead screws for anything?,"First, I hate Flathead screws for what I believe are self-evident reasons.

Second, I don't understand why switches mount with Phillips or combination Flathead-Phillips, but the plates mount with Flatheads.

After researching screws (no kidding) on Wikipedia, I've determined that there is a really interesting history of screws, but no explanation for why we still use Flathead screws.

EDIT: Excellent feedback. I accidentally clicked on the exclamation mark - I don't think the question has been answered by a long shot. It remains open, and weird. 

1) Aesthetics are largely subjective; to say that a line is more aesthetically pleasing than a star, hex, triangle, square,or any of the other screw drive types ([longer list here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw#Types_of_screw_drives)) is a bit of a stretch. 

2) As far as being less noticeable, I disagree. A Spanner head or Robertson would look pleasing on a wall plate. 

3) As for paint issues, no one that I know spray's on wall plates - you remove these before painting, or tape over them. 

4) Lastly, as far as concerns of stripping bolts go, multiple individuals have pointed out the utility of Robertson heads; the inability to strip them because you have a limited number of drivers, unlike philips.

As for myself, I use torque / torx heads or Robertson when I can, tolerate Phillips, and continue to grit my teeth when using Flathead screws.

EDIT2: **eelnitsud** provides the following succinct reasoning:

&gt;A flat head screw is used when a higher amount of torque is needed. It's shape allows it to be tightened tighter without the tool slipping. A philips head screw is used to prevent overtightening by allowing the tool to slip when a certain tention is reached. Flat head screws have been around much longer than power tools. - source: electrical trade school."

**[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx) is my summation of the bill**.

**[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vrt9x/obamacare_pointbypoint/) is Part 1 of the Point-By-Point**

.

As I said before, this is a huge undertaking. The [current version of the bill](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf) is 974 pages long, and I'm going through it bit by bit. But it's going to take a while to do it. I'll keep adding to this until I'm finished, but given that I have a job and a social life, I can't say how long it'll take.

Also, I'll try to address questions people have as best I can, but again, it might take me a while to get back to you. Please be patient.

So, without further ado, here goes...

(**Note: I am NOT an expert! I'm just a guy. If I have made an error on any of this, please let me know!**)

(**Note: For the sake of clarity and continuity, any references to page numbers will be referring to the PDF file, not the page number in the document**)

**[Page 198, Sec. 2001](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=198)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2014, everyone up to 133% of the poverty line is covered by Medicaid. From what I can tell, looking at the Social Security Act, it looks like it's currently a mishmesh of various qualifications, one being that a person is under 100% of the poverty line. So this will make for a pretty huge number of people who Medicaid grows to encompass. This section also increases federal funding to support the increase. However, it should be mentioned that a [recent court ruling](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf), amongst other things, made it clear that individual states could opt not to do this. However, in Justice Roberts' opinion ""Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer."", so in other words, States can't be forced to do this, but they can be given incentives to do this.

**[Page 210, Sec. 2004](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=210)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2014, Medicaid covers former foster children under the age of 26.

**[Page 210, Sec. 2005](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=210)** - Increases the amount of Medicare money given to US Territories like Puerto Rico.

**[Page 211, Sec. 2006](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=211)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It looks like what it's doing is that starting in 2011, the amount of money the Federal Government chips in for medical care when there is a major disaster increases.

**[Page 212, Sec. 2007](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=212)** - Between 2014 and 2018, this cuts about $700,000,000 from a part of Medicaid called the Medicaid Improvement Fund, a yearly fund established to improve the management of Medicaid. Clearly, this was done to help fund this bill, which itself tries to improve Medicaid (along with everything else).

**[Page 213, Sec. 2101](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=213)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that Between October 2005 and September 2009, the amount of money allocated to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) increases, and this section says that states that want to get this increased funding need to make sure that the health insurance provided under CHIP meets the same standards as those in this bill.

**[Page 216, Sec. 2102](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=216)** - Alters two other bills, the Social Security Act, and the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA). It looks like it's just coordinating everything so it all makes sense together.

**[Page 217, Sec. 2201](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=217)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, by adding the following section.

**[Page 217, Sec. 1943](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=217)** - This calls for the creation of a website for people who use Medicaid and CHIP to sign up for and renew insurance plans using their state's insurance exchanges.

**[Page 219, Sec. 2202](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=219)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. From what I can tell, it looks like this allows a hospital to choose whether they want to be able to make a determination whether or not a patient is covered under Medicaid. I'm just guessing here, but I think that this is to streamline things and make it easier for hospitals to sign patients up for Medicaid if a patient looks like they might qualify for Medicaid.
 
**[Page 220, Sec. 2301](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=220)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to allow Medicaid to cover ""Freestanding Birth Centers"", which look like they are essentially an establishment which is *not* a hospital, but which provides services to mothers giving birth. So... picture a maternity ward without the rest of the hospital, and that seems like the sort of thing they're describing.
 
**[Page 221, Sec. 2302](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=221)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to say that if a child has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and the parents have chosen to pay for hospice care, that paying for hospice care doesn't mean that they are giving up any other forms of care that Medicaid and CHIP might provide for their child as well.

**[Page 222, Sec. 2303](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=222)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to provide those with a low income (an amount which is to be decided by each State) access to family planning medical services. From what I can tell, this means stuff like STD testing, contraceptives, etc.

Okay, it looks like a lot of the stuff coming up pertains to long-term care - for people who are bedridden and need medical supervision, people who are in a nursing home or have an in-home caregiver, etc.

**[Page 225, Sec. 2304](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=225)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to clarify the wording of one part.

**[Page 225, Sec. 2401](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=225)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that beginning in October 2011, states may provide those with an income level under 150% of the poverty line (which, like I said in Part 1, is based on your age and how many people are in your household) care in a nursing home, in-home care, etc. It looks like this section is optional for States to follow, but those that choose to do it (and follow numerous standards set in place by this section) will benefit from an increase in Federal funding.

**[Page 230, Sec. 2402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=230)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create regulations for various types of state-provided long-term care (again, stuff like nursing homes and in-home care), allowing states to cater to those who could benefit from different kinds of long-term care while still working within pre-set standards.

**[Page 233, Sec. 2403](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=233)** - Alters another bill, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Reading around on this, it looks like this has to do with states funding long-term care, and transitioning into and out of hospitals (as opposed to nursing homes and in-home care). The Deficit Reduction Act had a part to smooth this transition, and this section extends that part, as well as expanding the people it can cover (based on how long a person has been receiving long-term care).

**[Page 234, Sec. 2404](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=234)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It's hard to parse through this one, since it bounces around to different sections of the Social Security Act, but the gist of it seems to deal with a part of the Social Security Act that happens when your spouse becomes institutionalized in some form of long-term care, and the state helps with your expenses during that time (because long-term medical care can be costly). This section seems to make it so that from 2014-2019, this help also includes medical coverage.

**[Page 234, Sec. 2405](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=234)** - Sets aside $50,000,000 (over a five-year period) to help pay for another bill, the Older Americans Act of 1965.

**[Page 234, Sec. 2406](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=234)** - This is basically the bill talking about how important a topic long-term care is, and saying in a general way that Congress should talk about it more and that more support should be made for community-level care (like nursing homes and in-home care) as opposed to only hospital care.

**[Page 235, Sec. 2501](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=235)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to increase the size of the drug rebates poor people get through Medicaid, and also to specify that no rebates are to be for an amount *higher* than the average price of the drug.

**[Page 238, Sec. 2502](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=238)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to allow Medicaid to cover more types of drugs, including Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, and drugs that help people to quit smoking.

**[Page 239, Sec. 2503](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=239)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It looks like this sets a way to determine what the limits are for how much Medicaid is supposed to reimburse people for pharmacy drugs.

**[Page 242, Sec. 2551](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=242)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. This one is cutting a lot of money from payments made to states called Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments. These are payments that states then turn over to hospitals to help compensate them for treating emergency patients who don't have insurance. Clearly the idea is that since more patients will have insurance after the PPACA goes into full swing, hospitals won't need as much of these funds. From 2014-2020, $18.1 Billion will be cut from the amount given to states for this, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to decide how much each state gets cut based on what percentage of their population is insured, as well as a few other factors.

**[Page 243, Sec. 2601](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=243)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. I'm not entirely sure about this, because it's hard to find information on it, but it looks like it gives states the option to get 5-10-year waivers so they don't have to follow Federal regulations for Medicaid when it comes to ""Demonstration Projects"" (Look farther down to see some of these), which looks like they are ways to test out new alternate approaches to Medicaid. However, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources can pull the plug on these waivers if it looks like a Demonstration Project isn't working the way it is intended.

**[Page 244, Sec. 2602](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=244)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to create the [Federal Coordinated Health Care Office](https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/CMSLeadership/Office_FCHCO.html), which is in charge of managing the areas of overlap between Medicare and Medicaid, to make it more effective and efficient for people who qualify for both to get the services they're covered for, and make sure there's not any waste.

**[Page 246, Sec. 2701](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=246)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 246, Sec. 1139B](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=246)** - On a yearly basis from 2011-2014, and then every three years after 2014, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to write a report on recommended standards for adult care for Medicaid patients, much like a similar report that's already written for children. This section also calls for the establishment of the Medicaid Quality Measurement Program to develop and test better methods of adult care (again, like a similar program already in existence for children). $60 Million will be set aside every year from 2010-2014 to fund this program.

**[Page 248, Sec. 2702](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=248)** - From what I can tell, this part directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to look at individual state practices that withhold payment from hospitals for health conditions caused by the hospitals' own neglect and negligence, and adopt them as general Medicaid practices.

**[Page 248, Sec. 2703](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=248)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2011, states may choose to offer medical plans for those with chronic conditions that they're calling a ""Health Home"", which appears to be a phrase that doesn't mean what it seems to. A ""Health Home"" doesn't seem to be an actual ""home"" per se, but more like a team of specialists assigned to look after you and coordinate your care.

**[Page 252, Sec. 2704](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=252)** - From 2012-2016, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up one of those ""Demonstration Projects"" I mentioned earlier to test the effectiveness of doing bundled programs in Medicaid.

**[Page 254, Sec. 2705](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=254)** -  From 2010-2012,The Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up another one of those ""Demonstration Projects"" to give participating States an option to try out a different Medicaid payment structure for hospitals, so instead of paying hospitals based on the quantity of service they give, it's based on the quality.

**[Page 255, Sec. 2706](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=255)** - From 2012-2016, The Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up another one of those ""Demonstration Projects"". This one gives states the opportunity to allow hospitals to become ""Pediatric Accountable Care Organization"", which looks like it's a way to reward Pediatric hospitals who find ways of saving money without reducing the amount of care patients receive.

**[Page 256, Sec. 2707](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=256)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up another ""Demonstration Project"". This one gives states the opportunity to allow private psychiatric hospitals to be covered under Medicaid. This section allocates $75 Million for this, and specifies that it will be a three-year project that will happen sometime between 2011 and 2015.

**[Page 258, Sec. 2801](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=258)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to try to improve MACPAC, which looks like it handles Medicaid and CHIP payments. This section clarifies wording, emphasizes efficiency and preventive care, and adds in a bunch of directions to communicate more clearly and frequently with Congress and the states, as well as coordinating with MedPAC, which handles Medicare payments. It also allocates $9 Million for this in 2010, as well as reallocating $2 Million from Social Security for this (out of $12 Billion that year - so comparatively speaking not much).

**[Page 263, Sec. 2901](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=263)** - Goes into more detail on some rules regarding Native American Indians and the Indian Health Service.

**[Page 263, Sec. 2902](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=263)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that a reimbursement to Native American Indian hospitals under Medicare Part B, previously due to expire in 2010, will continue on.

**[Page 264, Sec. 2951](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=264)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 264, Sec. 511](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=264)** - 6 months after the bill passes, all states must conduct a ""statewide needs assessment"" to identify communities with high levels of crime, poverty, etc., how good state programs are at providing at-home medical visits for children, and the effectiveness of substance abuse treatment programs. States are report this information to the Secretary of Health and Human Resources, as well as informing the Secretary of what they intend to do to improve the situation in their state. This section authorizes the Secretary to make grants to states for these improvements (with an emphasis on communities in particularly bad shape), and directs the Secretary to track the improvements made after 3-5 years. This section also directs the Secretary to coordinate these efforts with the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the Administration for Children and Families. From 2010-2014, $1.5 Billion is set aside for this section.

**[Page 274, Sec. 2952](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=274)** - Directs the Director of the National Institute of Mental
Health to conduct a study on postpartum depression, and alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 275, Sec. 512](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=275)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use grant money for projects to diagnose and treat postpartum depression. The Secretary is to track the progress of these projects and report to Congress on the results. $3 Million is set aside for this in 2010, and ""sums as may be necessary"" in 2011 and 2012.

**[Page 277, Sec. 2953](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=277)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 277, Sec. 513](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=277)** - From 2010-2014, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources will give each state funding (based on the size of that state's population between ages 10-19) for sex education programs (pushing both abstinence *and* contraception). $375 Million is to be set aside for this from 2010-2014, with some of that specifically set aside for youths who are homeless, have AIDS, live in areas with high youth birth rates, etc. Along with this, there are calls for studies to see how effective these programs are in reducing youth pregnancy rates.

**[Page 282, Sec. 2954](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=282)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to reinstate funding for abstinence-only sex education programs from 2010-2014.

**[Page 283, Sec. 2955](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=283)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2010, children without a parent (or who don't want their parents to be in charge of their medical decisions) are given more information about the importance of designating a Power of Attorney when it looks like they may need one to make medical decisions for them.

**[Page 285, Sec. 3001](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=285)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2013, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a ""hospital value-based purchasing program"" so that instead of reimbursing hospitals based on the number of patients they have treated, they are reimbursed based on their success with a measure of specific conditions (heart failure, pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction), surgeries, and stuff like negligence. These measures are to take into account stuff like age, sex, race, severity of illness, etc., as well as the hospitals' prior success with these conditions, how much they've improved, and how they compare to other hospitals.

**[Page 296, Sec. 3002](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=296)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to extend a program called the Physician Quality Reporting System, which offers an increase in pay as an incentive to doctors to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services about the quality measures taken in their hospital. This amount decreases in 2012, and ends in 2015. Starting in 2015, doctors who *fail* to make these reports will have their pay reduced, and in 2016 it will be reduced even further.

**[Page 298, Sec. 3003](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=298)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, starting in 2012, to use claims data (and possibly other data) to give doctors information about resources and methods available to them to improve care for their patients.

**[Page 301, Sec. 3004](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=301)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to make it so that starting in 2014, long-term care hospitals that fail to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services about the quality measures taken in their hospital will receive reduced funding.

**[Page 304, Sec. 3005](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=304)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct ""PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospitals"", beginning in 2014, to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services about the quality measures taken in their hospital.

**[Page 305, Sec. 3006](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=305)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a ""value-based purchasing plan"" in Medicare for ""skilled nursing facilities"", ""home health agencies"" and ""ambulatory surgical centers"", to make the pay they get under Medicare to be based on the quality of care they give based on criteria to be determined by the Secretary. These plans were to be presented to Congress throughout 2011.

**[Page 307, Sec. 3007](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=307)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to come up with a ""value-based payment modifier"" to begin in 2013, which will pay doctors based on the quality and cost-effectiveness of their care (based on measures to be set by the Secretary).

**[Page 310, Sec. 3008](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=310)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2015, hospitals get less money when they treat patients for problems caused by their own negligence. This section also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study in 2012 to see how this change will affect quality of care and costs.

**[Page 312, Sec. 3011](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=312)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 312, Sec. 399HH](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=312)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to create a report in 2011 on a strategy to improve the delivery of health care services that will be presented to Congress. This strategy will be updated at least once a year, with annual updates submitted to Congress.

**[Page 314, Sec. 3012](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=314)** - Directs the President to put together an ""Interagency Working Group on Health Care Quality"", comprised of senior representatives from numerous agencies and departments (everything from the Department of Health and Human Services to the US Coast Guard), with the purpose of coordinating efforts between departments as they pertain to the strategy outlined in the last section. This group is to present a yearly report to Congress on their progress and recommendations.

**[Page 315, Sec. 3013](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=315)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to reorganize a part of that bill to make room for the following section, which is to be added.

**[Page 316, Sec. 931](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=316)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to consult with the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services at least three times a year to look for any gaps in their quality measures. The Secretary will award grants to expand these quality measures as needed. This section also alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to have the Administrator of the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services develop quality measures for those programs. From 2010-2014, $375 Million will be set aside for this section.

**[Page 319, Sec. 3014](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=319)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. The part of the Social Security Act it refers to creates a privately-owned non-profit group comprised of both health insurance representatives, as well as representatives of consumer advocacy groups, whose job it is to recommend ways to improve the quality and efficiency of health-care. What this section looks like it does is direct this group to recommend specific measures, and direct the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to keep track of how well these measures do.

**[Page 323, Sec. 3015](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=323)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 323, Sec. 399II](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=323)** - The language is a bit confusing, but it looks like this section directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to create more efficient ways to collect data on the cost and effectiveness of health care, and directs the Secretary to give grants and contracts to organizations and individuals that will assist in this task.

**[Page 324, Sec. 399JJ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=324)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to create a website to report to the public on how successful the measures taken to ensure quality of care have been. This report will be provider-specific, so it looks like this will actually be a way to compare how effective different health care providers are.

**[Page 325, Sec. 3021](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=325)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 325, Sec. 115A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=325)** - Starting on January 1, 2011, this section creates something called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMI), meant to test new ways to make Medicare services and payments easier and more efficient, while keeping or improving the quality of care for patients. They have a website, which you can see [here](http://innovations.cms.gov/). There are 20 methods to be tested that are outlined in the ACA, but the Secretary may direct the CMI to test others that look like they have a good chance of improving Medicare and Medicaid. $10,005,000,000 will be set aside for this program from 2010-2019. Starting in 2012, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources is to submit a yearly report to Congress on the CMI. A few other minor language changes are made to the Social Security Act as well, mostly to accommodate the addition of the CMI.

**[Page 332, Sec. 3022](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=332)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 332, Sec. 1899](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=332)** - By January 1, 2012, the Secretary of health and Human Services is to establish the Medicare Shared Savings Program. This program allows for the creation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), organizations comprised of a group of health care providers (hospitals, doctors, etc.). These organizations may then receive payments for lowering costs while maintaining standards of care for Medicare patients. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is to determine what these standards are, and how they are to be measured and reported. Basically, if a hospital or other qualified group of caregivers can find ways to reduce Medicare costs without sacrificing quality of care, they'll be rewarded for doing so (and undoubtedly successful methods can then be extended to other areas of Medicare).

**[Page 337, Sec. 3023](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=337)** - By January 1, 2013, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a ""pilot program"" to test to see if hospitals and doctors bundling payments (like how your cable and internet bill might be bundled) can help to lower costs without lowering the quality of care for patients. By January 1, 2015, the Secretary is to report to Congress on the progress of this program. By January 1, 2016, the Secretary is to report to Congress on the results of this program.

**[Page 343, Sec. 3024](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=343)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 343, Sec. 1866E](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=343)** - Starting January 1, 2012, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a ""demonstration program"" to test payment incentives for doctors, nurses, etc. that provide on-call 24/7 in-home care. Basically, it looks like the thinking is that maybe if people with chronic conditions can get check-ups at home, they'll be less likely to need to go back to the hospital repeatedly for the same problem, less likely to make a trip to the emergency room, and more likely to get better-quality care. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is to develop standards for the care given to patients, and doctors who can reduce the costs of care for their patients while still meeting these standards will get incentive payments. $30,000,000 is set aside for this program from 2010-2015, and the Secretary is to report to Congress on its progress.

The next few sections focus on reducing readmissions, where a patient keeps coming back for the same problem. Apparently, this is a big drain on Medicare. ""One in five patients discharged from a hospital - approximately 2.6 million seniors - is readmitted within 30 days, at a cost of over $26 billion every year"" ( [Source: The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation](http://www.innovations.cms.gov/initiatives/Partnership-for-Patients/CCTP/index.html?itemID=CMS1239313) ).

**[Page 347, Sec. 3025](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=347)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2012, the payments made under Medicare to hospitals will be slightly reduced in cases of excessive readmission. This is apparently to encourage hospitals to fix the problem a patient comes in with in the first place. This section also adds the following section to another bill, the Public Health Service Act.

**[Page 352, Sec. 399KK](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=352)** - Within two years of the enactment of this section (So... March, 2012, I think), the Secretary of Health and Human Services will make a program for hospitals with a high amount of readmissions to improve their readmission rates. So, while the previous section penalizes them for having too many readmissions, this one helps them to get their readmissions to acceptable levels. Hospitals that do this will report to the Secretary on the changes they make and how effective they are.

**[Page 352, Sec. 3026](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=352)** - From January 1, 2011, to January 1, 2016, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources will create a program to try and improve the care for patients being transitioned from one location (like a hospital) to another (such as the at-home care or Community-Based Organizations, for the purpose of reducing readmissions.

**[Page 354, Sec. 3027](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=354)** - Alters another bill, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, to extend a demonstration project in that bill to last roughly another year, and setting aside an additional $1,600,000 for this. This demonstration project had to do with gainsharing. From what I can tell, it looks like the idea is to give doctors and hospital staff incentive to reduce costs (without reducing the quality of care) by giving them a portion of that savings.

**[Page 355, Sec. 3101](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=355)** - This section was repealed. I'm not sure what it was before, but it's nothing more than a placeholder now.

**[Page 355, Sec. 3102](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=355)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to renew one part that sets a bottom limit for the Work Geographic Index (used for determining Medicare costs), as well as adding what looks like some additional criteria for determining those costs.

**[Page 357, Sec. 3103](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to renew one part that allows people to be exempted from some of the costs due to physical therapy expenses.

**[Page 357, Sec. 3104](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits
Improvement and Protection Act of 2000. It's really hard to read through this, but as best I can tell, this just extends Medicare payments for laboratory services for an additional year (2010).

**[Page 357, Sec. 3105](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. This one's also a bit difficult to read, but from what I can tell, it's just renewing funding for ambulance services for Medicare patients through 2011.

**[Page 357, Sec. 3106](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007. Another one that's difficult to read, but from what I can tell, it's just renewing funding for long-term care hospitals for Medicare patients for another two years.

**[Page 357, Sec. 3107](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=357)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Improvements for Patients
and Providers Act of 2008, extending funding for mental health treatments for Medicare patients an additional year (until 2010).

**[Page 358, Sec. 3108](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=358)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting on January 1, 2011, Physician Assistants are added to the list of professionals (line nurses and doctors) allowed to order ""post-hospital extended care services"", services that a patient can be given after a 3+ day stay at a hospital. In other words, it's just giving physician assistants more freedom to sign you up for services you need after a long hospital stay.

**[Page 358, Sec. 3109](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=358)** -
Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It looks like this is just clarifying when pharmacies have to send accreditation information regarding their quality standards to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as indicating exemptions for certain types of pharmacies.

**[Page 359, Sec. 3110](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=359)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It looks like the gist of it is that some beneficiaries of Tricare (civilian health benefits for veterans) will have an additional year to enroll in Medicare Part B, if they choose to do so.

**[Page 360, Sec. 3111](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=360)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to reduce the amount paid to hospitals for X-Ray bone density scans in 2010 and 2011, as well as directing the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to work with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to conduct a report on the effect that this has.

**[Page 361, Sec. 3112](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=361)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to cut all the funds going to the Medicare Improvement Fund in 2014. Specifically, this is cutting $22,290,000,000. Most likely this cut is because the PPACA does many of the same things the Medicare Improvement Fund is intended to, so this payment would be redundant.

**[Page 361, Sec. 3113](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=361)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a two-year demonstration project, starting July 1, 2011, where complex lab tests are paid using separate payments. No later than two years after the demonstration project is completed (so by July 1, 2015), the Secretary is to report to Congress on how this affected expenses and quality of care. $5,000,000 is set aside for this section from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Program Management Account, and the actual payments themselves are to get funds from the Federal Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund.

216,explainlikeimfive,I'm only gonna post this once to avoid sounding like a hypocrite but please read...,"This subreddit is rising as a scary rate. I subscribed about 20 minutes ago and it said 1,000 readers - now it's at around ~~2,500~~ ~~4,000~~ nearly 20,000 readers. Checking the new queue, I'm seeing a disappointing number of submissions that are getting completely lost/ignored and also a bunch of submissions that are stupid attempts at the poster being funny.

I'm just going to say three things:

* **CHECK THE NEW QUEUE.**
* **USE YOUR VOTES.**
* **KEEP YOUR SUBMISSIONS SERIOUS.**

I know the last one sounds like I'm being a dick/boring/too serious but I see a lot of potential in this subreddit and I'd rather miss out on a few short-lived laughs from (p/f)unny titles to avoid compromising this subreddit.

Thanks that is all.

**Edit:** Two things? Three, I meant.

**Edit 2:** As an addition, two more points:

* **USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION.** So far, there's been 3 posts on stocks, 2 on the internet, 2 on ISPs (I posted the first 2 hours ago and got 4 upvotes, the second one is from 30 minutes ago and has 14 upvotes *sigh*), 2 on money laundering and I'm sure plenty more. It takes like 5 seconds to enter a keyword and search.
* ** DON'T POST QUESTIONS THAT HAVE SINGLE, DEFINITIVE ANSWERS.** Please take it to [/r/answers](http://reddit.com/r/answers). No submissions like, ""Can someone explain to me the density of hydrogen?"" when you actually are asking, ""What is the density of hydrogen?"" for example.

* **Read the sidebar!** Maybe if it's been awhile, you can just glance over it. Or make sure your controversial comment or post fits our rather lax guidelines and rules.

* **Ask ""why"" questions!** This isn't a strict rule at all, but it makes for better discussion. Also, be specific instead of just saying ""ELI5: some huge topic.""

* **Use the themes!** They're fun.

* **Mark your posts as answered!** Please! And you can still comment on a post that is answered and add to the discussion-- it's more for the sake of the subreddit archive (and people who casually just want to see answered questions).

I have to give a huge shoutout to /u/lucas747 for configuring /r/ExplainLikeImFiveBot. It does a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff and lucas747 has been really patient and helpful in programming it! Hasn’t addressed the problem that it’s semi-sentient yet though.

***

The beauty of this subreddit in my opinion is twofold. First, that explanations can vary from spot-on analogies to layman-friendly summaries of scientific, political, cultural, or other information. And also the fact that this subreddit isn't about OP! That's the best part. There are 300,000 people who will see your explanation, and who will have a question answered that they've never even thought to ask. That's why I personally love this subreddit. I see a question that seems so obvious, and yet upon closer inspection it is very curious. And then five people explain it in terms I can understand, each with their own spin on it. Then there's healthy (or heated!) discussion, and all of a sudden we have four comments in the top ten on /r/bestof.

Looking forward to many more explainers. Tell your friends!

It's not just about OP. We have the ""answered"" tag (which we'll get to later on) for people who *aren't* OP to find answers if they don't know. The great thing about ELI5 is that you'll find fascinating^5 explanations to things you'd never even thought to wonder about. It's awesome!

3. LAYMAN-FRIENDLY

This is the big one. ***ELI5 is not about explaining things on a literal five year old level!*** ^6 Please Please PLEASE don't be obnoxious and think you're funny by saying ""I'm five and I didn't get that!"" On the other side of the coin, **don't dumb your explanation down** to be comprehendible by a five year old. Use layman-friendly vocabulary (or define technical terms), and use analogies if they fit, but don't try to force anything. Just explain it to someone who wouldn't be familiar with it. For a role-playing Q&amp;A subreddit, try /r/explainlikeiama.

&gt;**General Guidelines**

Guidelines, not rules. Even the third one isn't a *rigid* rule, but you get the idea.

&gt;Be polite and respectful-- rude, offensive, and judgmental posts will be removed at the discretion of the mods.

&gt;Avoid bias. Discussion of politics and other controversial topics is allowed and often necessary, but try to remain textbook-level fair to all sides, for both questions and answers. Acknowledging your own bias is often a great way to advance the conversation.

Just be candid in your responses. Flaming is no good either. Not only is controversy ""allowed and often necessary,"" it's encouraged! Just keep it respectful.

&gt;Trolls and unapproved bots will be banned.

If it's spammy. Just run it by the mods.

&gt;Remember the top answer may not always be the best one. It could even be incorrect-- be sure to read multiple responses!

If a top-level answer is fundamentally incorrect (and proven so-- the mods are not experts), and *especially* if the next visible comment does not refute it, we may remove it at our discretion.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&gt; **Submission Guidelines**

&gt; The best questions ask why or how something happens or came to pass.

Absolutely. ""Why"" questions are awesome. Note that even a simple question that does not ask ""why"" can provoke great discussion and explanations, so this is certainly not a rule.

Just as importantly, avoid saying ELI5: Bitcoins. Not only has that been asked a million times^7 , but it also isn't very helpful. At least if you're going to title your post that way include a more specific query in the body of the post.

&gt;Do not ask yes-or-no questions or ask for a walkthrough/procedure-- try /r/answers or /r/techsupport. This is for conceptual explanations.

This is big. These posts will be removed. Also, askreddit type questions will be removed. We want **relatively objective questions only.** Ones up for interpretation and debate, but still relatively objective with less opinion-- in other words, not questions that purely poll the subreddit.

&gt;[Walter](http://i.imgur.com/mGwRQ.jpg) rule: Do not post a loaded question and ask “am I wrong?” Keep an open mind!

""Am I wrong? Am I wrong?"" ""You're not wrong, you're just an asshole."" This was a famous exchange in The Big Lebowski, in which Walter uses his line one too many times (probably talking about Vietnam). Try /r/changemyview if you're looking to be proven wrong, or just rephrase your question to be more conducive to positive discussion.

&gt;Be specific! Don't ask about a general topic if you can help it. The more detailed the better.

Like I said about the bitcoin question above. Be specific!

&gt;**Search** before submitting! If it's been asked before, indicate that the previous answers didn't help. Otherwise your question may be removed.

THIS 1,000,000 tiems irl. Please search. ELI5 is also an archive. If you need a more up-to-date explanation, try adjusting the search by date and then ask again if you can't find anything.

&gt;Remember the spirit of this subreddit. This is for getting simple answers to complex questions, not a repository of any questions.

#

&gt;Please mark your question as answered if you are satisfied with the responses! 

Yeah, please do that. Don't make /u/ExplainLikeImFiveBot come after you!^8,9

&gt;**Commenting Guidelines**

&gt;Do not use undefined jargon. Jargon is great, but provide a simple definition first.

&gt;Beware analogies--Analogies are great if they're not stretched. Use them strategically.

These are both really important, I've just already covered them.^10

&gt;Sources and links to further reading are encouraged, but please summarize them.

I think people will do this naturally. Don't just link to something without explaining why!

&gt;Try not to speculate, and if you do so logically, please note that you are not 100% sure in your answer.

No one will judge you for not knowing something. If they do, welcome to the internet.

&gt;ELI5 is not for literal five year olds. It is for average redditors. Preschooler-friendly stories tend to be more confusing and patronizing.

So that about covers everything. I'm approaching the character limit for the body of the self post, and this is by far the longest thing I've ever typed on reddit. Ironically, the shortest thing I ever typed on reddit, a blank space, is [my top comment of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14kao1/if_you_could_have_any_superpower_what_would_you/c7dusok).^13

Thank you for reading this far, if you've read it all without skipping you deserve some sort of medal. You could've used the time you spent reading this to make one. But no, you read this thing instead. Don't feel bad though, I'm the one that typed it all out.

And thanks for visiting ELI5! If you haven't subscribed already, please go for it! If you're reading this and you're new to reddit, you're probably subscribed BY DEFAULT because we're a DEFAULT subreddit now.

Happy redditing!

For the other mods,

285,explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why marijuana triggers panic attacks for certain people?,"Thanks for all the responses, guys! 

The reason I was asking is because of a mishap I had back when I was 17. Never smoked weed before and was feeling extra curious, so my friend set up a bowl for me (I guess that's a lot for a beginner?). So soon after, started getting short of breath, got panic wave, that pulsating stabbing feeling. 

So as my friends notice me freaking out, they decide to tell me that what I smoked wasn't weed. It was k2 (panic). You know, that stuff that gives people heart attacks. So after 13 hours it finally subsided, had that post traumatic look on life. 

I still don't smoke weed, I've tried it and the same result occurs, but thanks for giving me some insight as to why it happened. "

300,explainlikeimfive,"In Islamic countries, how are women who wear a face veil identified for official purposes?","There's a lot I don't understand here, not least how they identify each other in everyday situations. But what about getting a passport, visiting a prison, getting a library card, getting a driver's license (not relevant in ~~Iran~~ Saudia Arabia (thanks to buried_treasure) I know), passing through airport security or getting a bank card? The list goes on. 

If you're wearing a [burqa](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01428/Burqa_1428680c.jpg), a [niqāb](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Woman_in_burqa%2C_Aleppo.jpg/496px-Woman_in_burqa%2C_Aleppo.jpg), or most of all a [boshiya](http://mythousandtrinkets.weebly.com/uploads/7/1/2/6/7126647/7899797.jpg?279) then you won't be able to be identified at all. 

I suppose someone will say that they just take them off but the Qur'an is really clear about who they can reveal their 'modesty' to. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_clothing

I should clarify. I'm not just interested in how they're IDed in Islamic Countries but also how they're identified on entry to non islamic countries or when going about their business there. Could a women entering the United Kingdom with a face veil be asked to raise it?

Another edit: this is the passage that makes me wonder about female inspectors;

&gt;[Women] should [...] not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, **or their women**, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children...

As I said before, this is a huge undertaking. The [current version of the bill](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf) is 974 pages long, and I'm going through it bit by bit. But it's going to take a while to do it. I'll keep adding to this until I'm finished, but given that I have a job and a social life, I can't say how long it'll take.

Also, I'll try to address questions people have as best I can, but again, it might take me a while to get back to you. Please be patient.

So, without further ado, here goes...

(**Note: I am NOT an expert! I'm just a guy. If I have made an error on any of this, please let me know!**)

(**Note: For the sake of clarity and continuity, any references to page numbers will be referring to the PDF file, not the page number in the document**)

**[Page 362, Sec. 3114](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=362)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting on January 1, 2011, nurse-midwife services received through a fee schedule can receive up to as much as if those same services were administered by a doctor. The apparent purpose is to make nurse-midwife services more accessible.

**[Page 363, Sec. 3121](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=363)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to renew Medicare coverage for outpatient services in rural hospitals for another year (through January 1, 2011).

**[Page 363, Sec. 3122](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=363)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, to extend from July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2011, payments to rural hospitals for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests covered under Medicare Part B.

**[Page 363, Sec. 3123](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=363)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, to extend for an additional 5 years (ending sometime in 2014) a demonstration project to establish rural community hospitals. In addition, the number of these hospitals is doubled from 15 to 30, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to expand the states in which these hospitals can be located. This section also makes a series of minor language changes to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to make the language fit better.

**[Page 364, Sec. 3124](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=364)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to extend the Medicare Dependent Hospital (MDH) program for rural hospitals for another year (through October 1, 2012).

**[Page 365, Sec. 3125](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=365)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, For the fiscal years 2011 and 2012, the amount paid to low-volume hospitals is increased by up to 25%, based on how many patients they've discharged. In addition, for those years, what qualifies as a ""low-volume hospital"" is expanded to include hospitals that are over 15 miles away from another qualifying hospital (instead of 25 miles away).

**[Page 365, Sec. 3126](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=365)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, to expand a demonstration project revolving around community-level integrated health services on a county-by-county level. This section also removes the restriction on the number of counties that can be included in this demonstration project, and replaces some terminology.

**[Page 366, Sec. 3127](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=366)** - Directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to conduct a study on how adequate payments to rural hospitals are. This report is to be given to Congress by January 1, 2011.

**[Page 366, Sec. 3128](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=366)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to increase payments for emergency hospital services and ambulances from 100% of what is deemed a ""reasonable cost"" to 101%.

**[Page 366, Sec. 3129](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=366)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting on January 1, 2010, grant money in that bill given to rural hospitals stays available until it is used (rather than expiring). It also adds that this grant money can now be used to make sure these hospitals are up to the standards set in the PPACA.

**[Page 367, Sec. 3131](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=367)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2014, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will start to phase in changes to the amounts paid to caregivers for home health services, based on a number of factors, including the type and cost of services, whether the caregiver is rural or urban, whether the caregiver is for-profit or non-profit, etc. The phase-in is to be across 4 years, to make sure the shift in payments isn't too much of a shock to the market. In addition, this section directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to conduct a study on the effect this has on access to and quality of care. This report is to be given to Congress by January 1, 2015. On top of that, this section makes a number of smaller edits to indicate that the Secretary is to limit the amounts paid to these caregivers in a number of different ways. This section *also* alters another bill, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, to increase the payments made to rural home health services by 3% from April 1, 2010 to January 1, 2016. The Secretary is to conduct a study on home health agency costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary is to present this report to Congress no later than March 1, 2014. Also, after seeing the results of this study, the Secretary may conduct a demonstration project to test the changes recommended to improve services. If the Secretary decides to go ahead with this demonstration project, it is to last for four years, and start no later than January 1, 2015. The secretary is to set aside $500,000,000 from the the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to fund both the study and the demonstration project. And if the Secretary does choose to go ahead with this demonstration, he is to evaluate and report on it to Congress.

**[Page 371, Sec. 3132](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=371)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to gather data on payments for hospice care starting no later than January 1, 2011. At some point after October 1, 2013, the Secretary is to revise payments for hospice care. This section also says that a hospice care provider can only continue services if every 180 days they have a face-to-face meeting with the patient to determine whether that patient still needs hospice care.

**[Page 373, Sec. 3133](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=373)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2014, the method for determining disproportionate share hospital payments (payments to hospitals who treat indigent patients). will change, to be determined by a number of factors outlined here. It's a bit complicated, but the short version is that it looks like it'll be cutting these payments by about 75%, give or take. This is probably because it is expected that these hospitals will have far fewer uninsured patients to treat.

**[Page 375, Sec. 3134](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=375)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify which services are ""misvalued"" (that are more expensive than they need to be or can be made more efficient through bundling). The Secretary is to make adjustments to the amount we pay hospitals for these services. This section also repeals a part of another bill, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, that seems to direct the Secretary to just accept the generally accepted costs for these services. It also repeals a part of the Social Security Act that I'm having difficulty finding, but looks like it was something similar.

**[Page 377, Sec. 3135](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=377)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. I had to do some looking around online to get a feel for just what this does, but from what I see [here](http://primaryimmune.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/X08-ImagingPaymentUPDATED092911.pdf), it looks like starting in 2011, it's increasing from 50% to 75% a rate used in determining expenses related to costly diagnostic imaging equipment. and reduces the payments for the use of this equipment by 25%. This section also directs the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to report on whether this change in payments will reduce costs by $3,000,000,000. That report is to be made available no later than January 1, 2013. That strikes me as an oddly specific number, so I suspect that they expect that this *will* save that much.

**[Page 378, Sec. 3136](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=378)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to change the Medicare payment for powered wheelchairs. Beginning on January 1, 2011, for the first three months of paying for a powered wheelchair, it goes up from 10% of the cost to 15% of the cost, and for subsequent months it goes down from 7.5% of the cost to 6% of the cost.

**[Page 379, Sec. 3137](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=379)** - This one had me stuck longer than any other section so far. I had to look around for what others said about it to get a better idea. Some thanks go to [this](http://books.google.com/books?id=tCTt0sq2vaEC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;lpg=PA495&amp;dq=SEC.+3137.+%22wage+index%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xnn_lvnUTr&amp;sig=M4WiUHgS4gyHPe78yFwJ7ObrkWg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P1JeUKDKFeK6igLskIDgBg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=SEC.%203137.%20%22wage%20index%22&amp;f=false) Google Books archived book. Anyway, this section alters another bill, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, directing the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to report to Congress no later than December 31, 2011 on reforming the hospital wage index, which determines how Medicare will compensate various medical professionals. Anyway, the Secretary's report is to take numerous factors into consideration,and apparently is meant to contain costs.

**[Page 381, Sec. 3138](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=381)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on the costs associated with cancer hospitals compared to other hospitals. The secretary will determine an adjustment (presumably to payments) to account for the difference in costs.

**[Page 381, Sec. 3139](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=381)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, referring to payments for biosimilar biologics. Biologics are medical treatments made from living organisms (like vaccines), and ""biosimilar"" refers to products that are effectively the same as existing products. This section says that Medicare will pay 106% of the cost of existing products for these biosimilar ones. It looks like the idea is to give upstart drug companies a chance to break into the market so they can compete with major drug companies that already exist.

**[Page 382, Sec. 3140](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=382)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a Medicare Hospice Concurrent Care demonstration program, which will last for 3 years. As I understand it, hospice care is care for patients who are dying that doesn't attempt to treat the ailment that the patient is dying from, it only tries to ease their pain. Generally, Medicare recipients have to choose one or the other. The demonstration program this section creates will allow for some patients to choose both. This demonstration program is intended to be cost-neutral, and the Secretary is to report to Congress on how this affected quality of care and cost-effectiveness.

**[Page 383, Sec. 3141](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=383)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services in how to go about calculating the Hospital Wage Index Floor apparently, to ensure that no hospital has a wage index beneath what is legally required, while still making the changes in wage indexes budget neutral.

**[Page 383, Sec. 3142](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=383)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on costs and payments in urban Medicare-dependent hospitals. Within 9 months of the enactment of the PPACA, the secretary will submit this report to Congress.

**[Page 384, Sec. 3143](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=384)** - Says that nothing in the PPACA will reduce home health benefits guaranteed in the Social Security Act.

The next series of sections is all about Medicare Advantage. For those unaware, Medicare Advantage (also known as Medicare+Choice and Medicare Part C) is an optional Medicare program for those who want to get their insurance through a private provider. However, since it was created, Medicare Advantage costs have ballooned to be over 12% more than costs for comparable services under traditional Medicare ( [source](http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/85xx/doc8568/sprattltr8-17-07.pdf) ). The following sections, in a few different ways, seek to bring Medicare Advantage costs back in line with normal Medicare costs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that from 2012 to 2021, this will save $507 billion ( [source](http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12119/03-30-healthcarelegislation.pdf) ).

**[Page 384, Sec. 3201](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=384)** - Firstly, this section has been repealed and replaced after the PPACA was passed by another bill, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA). However, the new text has been entered here. It amends another bill, the Social Security Act. It's got a lot of talk about numbers, but the gist of it seems to be that it's going to be lowering the amount paid for Medicare Advantage until the costs are more in line with the costs of normal Medicare. This section seeks to bring those costs back down to something comparable to normal Medicare costs.

**[Page 389, Sec. 3202](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=389)** -  Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to specify that starting on January 1, 2011, some specific services under Medicare Advantage cannot cost more than those under Medicare Part A and B. This is essentially just additional details on the cost-saving stuff in section 3201. Also a lot of numbers talk regarding Medicare Advantage rebates.

**[Page 391, Sec. 3203](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=391)** -  Another section repealed and replaced by HCERA. The current section alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to make it so that adjustment of costs for Medicare Advantage services continues on a yearly basis (previously it only continued until 2010).

**[Page 392, Sec. 3204](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=392)** -  Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting in 2011, for the first 45 days of the year, people enrolled in Medicare Advantage can choose to change their plan to a standard Medicare plan.

**[Page 392, Sec. 3205](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=392)** -  Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to extend the Medicare Advantage Special Needs Program through 2014, as well as listing a lot of requirements that these plans would need to meet.

**[Page 395, Sec. 3206](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=395)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to renew until January 1, 2013 the ability for Medicare recipients to obtain Reasonable Cost Contracts.

**[Page 395, Sec. 3207](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=395)** - Making some sort of comment noting that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to extend service area waivers for Medicare Advantage plans for providers who contracted with the Secretary for those waivers prior to October 1, 2009.

**[Page 395, Sec. 3208](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=395)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to make permanent senior housing facilities created under a specific demonstration project as of December 31, 2009.

**[Page 396, Sec. 3209](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=396)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to clarify that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the right to reject bids for plans by a Medicare Advantage organization, and bids for plans by a Prescription Drug Plan sponsor, if those plans propose significant increases to costs or reductions to service.

**[Page 396, Sec. 3210](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=396)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to revise standards for supplemental Medicare benefit plans.

The next group of sections deals with Medicare Part D, the Medicare Drug Prescription Program

**[Page 397, Sec. 3301](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=397)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. Firstly, it says that starting January 1, 2011, any drug companies wanting to continue to work with Medicare Part D must participate in the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program outlined in this section. Secondly, it outlines the actual Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program, which also starts January 1, 2011. This section addresses the infamous ""Donut Hole"" in coverage, which plagued Medicare recipients who purchased enough drugs to surpass the prescription drug coverage limit, but not enough to qualify for catastrophic coverage. It does so by making the drug companies that work with Medicare give discounts to those who fall within that gap.

**[Page 405, Sec. 3302](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=405)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that the low-income benefit for Medicare part is calculated without taking into consideration discounts and rebates received under Medicare Advantage. This way, those getting discounts like that won't be penalized for it when purchasing drugs.

**[Page 405, Sec. 3303](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=405)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. From what I can tell, starting January 1, 2011, it makes it so the Secretary of Health and Human Services can allow a prescription drug plan to charge low-income beneficiaries the low-income subsidy if the plan's premium is more expensive than the low-income subsidy plus a ""de minimis"" amount. That amount is apparently $2 ( [source](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovContra/Downloads/MemoDeMinimisClarification_102706.pdf) ).

**[Page 406, Sec. 3304](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=406)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. This section deals with widows and widowers on low-income assistance. Normally, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services check beneficiaries' financial status on a regular basis to make sure they still qualify for low-income programs, and if someone is making too much money in a given timeframe, they may no longer qualify as ""low income"". However, generally when someone's wife or husband dies, they inherit their significant others' stuff. This section says that that check on beneficiaries' status can not happen within a year of the death of a spouse, so someone isn't dropped from Medicare or Medicaid just because they lost a loved one. This section goes into effect January 1, 2011.

**[Page 406, Sec. 3305](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=406)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that no later than January 1, 2011, when the Secretary of Health and Human Resources reassigns someone to a different Medicare drug plan (apparently due to a change in their economic status), they are to be informed of the differences between their old plan and the new one, as well as being informed of their right to request a coverage determination, exception, or reconsideration.

**[Page 407, Sec. 3306](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=407)** - Alters another bill, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, by designating an additional $15,000,000 be set aside to fund the State Health Insurance Program from 2010 through 2012, an additional $15,000,000 be set aside to fund Aging and Disability Resource Centers from 2010 through 2012, an additional $5,000,000 be set aside to fund a contract with the National Center for Benefits and Outreach Enrollment from 2010 through 2012. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can request support from the entities funded by this section for wellness and disease prevention outreach programs.

**[Page 408, Sec. 3307](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=408)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. As I understand it, starting in 2011, Medicate Advantage insurance companies must include coverage for specific categories of drugs designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Until the secretary designates which drugs are to be covered, these categories are to include anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antineoplastics, antipsychotics, antiretrovirals, and immunosuppressants for the treatment of transplant rejection.

**[Page 409, Sec. 3308](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=409)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. From what I can tell, starting on January 1, 2011, if you make over $80,000 ($160,000 for couples filing taxes jointly), your Medicare Part D monthly costs will increase in a fashion similar to Medicare Part B. This amount will be taken out of your social security.

**[Page 412, Sec. 3309](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=412)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act so that on a date no earlier than January 1, 2012, if you're eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and receiving home or community-based services instead of going to a hospital, you can't also qualify for cost-sharing under Medicare Part D. From what I can tell, this is because they can most likely get cost-sharing by other means.

**[Page 412, Sec. 3310](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=412)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, so that starting on January 1, 2012, drug plans for patients in long-term care facilities must be more efficiently managed and drugs given to patients must be dispensed in a more efficient manner, using uniform dispensing techniques, to reduce waste.

**[Page 413, Sec. 3311](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=413)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create and maintain a complaint system, to be made available on Medicare.gov, and the Secretary shall report yearly to Congress on this system. It looks like [this](http://medicare.gov/claims-and-appeals/file-a-complaint/complaints.html) is the page for complaints.

**[Page 413, Sec. 3312](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=413)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to make a standard and uniform appeals process for those who feel their claim should not have been denied. This is to happen by January 1, 2012.

**[Page 414, Sec. 3313](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=414)** - Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a study about the type of drugs used by those in Medicare Advantage plans, which the Secretary of Health and Human Resources is to present to Congress no later than July 1 every year starting in 2011. The Inspector General is also to conduct a study on the 200 most frequently-used Medicare Part D drugs and their pricing under both normal Medicare and Medicare Advantage. That report is to be given to Congress no later than October 1, 2011.

**[Page 415, Sec. 3314](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=415)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act. This one is hard to parse, but from what I can tell, it makes it so that starting on January 1, 2011, drugs paid by AIDS drug programs and Indian Health Services count towards calculations for determining qualification for Medicare Part D catastrophic care. I imagine that this is because someone with AIDS definitely needs catastrophic care. Not sure what Indian Health Services has to do with anything, though.

**[Page 416, Sec. 3315](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=416)** - This section was repealed by another bill, HCERA. However, it replaces it with similar text, which is mirrored here. It alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to give a $250 rebate to Medicare recipients who fall into that ""donut hole"" that I mentioned above in Section 3301. It's only in effect for 2010.

**[Page 417, Sec. 3401](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=417)** - This section alters another bill, the Social Security Act. It reduces the increases in payments that many various types of medical facilities and services were going to be getting through Medicare, undoubtedly to keep down Medicare's ballooning costs. For some of these services, it reduces those increases gradually, starting at a quarter of a percent less than what those payment increases were going to be, gradually going up to three-quarters of a percent less than what the payment increases were going to be. For some, it reduces increases in payments based on a productivity assessment (which, from what I can tell, is based primarily on what operating costs are). For some, it reduces the increases in payments by a flat amount. And for some, it reduces the increases in payment using some combination of those three methods. It bears note that this is undoubtedly what some alarmists believe is a reduction in Medicare services, but none of these reduce Medicare payments below what they are now, they only slow down the speed at which Medicare costs are *rising*, and it seems like it's largely trying to keep payments close to the actual costs needed by these facilities and services.

**[Page 426, Sec. 3402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=426)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to say that from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019, ""income thresholds"" (if you earn more than that amount a year, you're considered high-income) for Medicare Part B will be frozen at their 2010 levels, rather than being tied to inflation like they previously had been. Looking around, apparently those thresholds are currently at $85,000 if you're single and $170,000 if you're filing taxes jointly. Freezing the thresholds means they'll stay at those dollar amounts instead of rising with inflation.

**[Page 426, Sec. 3403](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=426)** - Alters another bill, the Social Security Act, to create the Independent Medicare Advisory Board. This is one of the sections that brought up talk of ""death panels!"", but the truth is it's pretty benign. The board is to be comprised of 15 experts (who cannot hold any other employment while they are part of the board, so there's no conflict of interest) who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, as well as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator of the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, who will be nonvoting members. The presidential appointees serve 6-year nonconsecutive terms. The board's purpose is to reduce Medicare spending per person by submitting proposals to be enacted by the Secretary unless Congress says otherwise. These proposals *must* cut costs, *must not* ration health care, and *must not* increase costs to Medicare recipients, *must not* cut Medicare benefits, and *must not* modify eligibility criteria. In addition, until 2019, these proposals *must not* reduce payments for hospitals and services (probably because the ACA already does some of that). It can cut payments for administrative expenses. The board is also to try and make its proposals increase Medicare solvency, improve quality of care, improve access to services, and reduce spending in areas with excess growth in costs, while also taking into consideration the needs of care providers. Before these proposals go to the Secretary, they are to be reviewed by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. Then the Secretary reviews them, and then they are brought to Congress. Starting in 2014, these proposals are to be brought to both houses of Congress and the President by January 15 each year. The President will review this proposal for two days before bringing his own proposal to Congress. A few different committees in Congress are to review this proposal and report back to Congress on it by April 1. Congress is not allowed to make another bill to repeal or alter congressional consideration, although the Senate may waive Congressional consideration by use of a three-fifths vote that's subject to appeal. This section goes into all sorts of Congressional rules for how the proposal is to be considered before deciding whether to pass it. Anyway, Congress votes on whether to pass it, and the President may choose to veto it if it is passed (like any other bill). If the proposal passes, it is to be implemented by August 15. Additionally, in 2017, Congress can vote on whether to discontinue the board. If the board didn't create a proposal in a given year, it is still to report to Congress on matters relating to Medicare, and every year regardless it is to create a public report as well. They are also to do a yearly advisory report on recommendations for ways to improve health care outside of Medicare.

**[Page 448, Sec. 3501](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=448)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 448, Sec. 933](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=448)** - Okay, I've had a damn difficult time trying to find the actual text of the Public Health Service Act. Everything I come up with doesn't seem to fit the text that this bill is inserting into it. This section directs the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to research, create, and to put into practice quality improvement practices and create training for those practices, and to and to this end it directs the Director to establish The Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety of AHRQ. This section sets aside $20,000,000 for 2010 though 2014 to be put towards carrying out this section.

**[Page 452, Sec. 934](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=452)** - Directs the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to give out grants to health providers that need financial help meeting the quality improvement measures mentioned in section 933. Recipients of these grants need to match every $5 of funds they receive with $1 of their own.

**[Page 454, Sec. 3502](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=454)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and human Services to establish a program to provide grants for community-based ""health teams"" to support primary care providers. It looks like this is creating a community-based support system of professionals so primary care doctors have specialists to refer patients to. These ""health teams"" need to have a plan to be self-sustaining within three years.

**[Page 457, Sec. 3503](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=457)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the next section.

**[Page 457, Sec. 935](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=457)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to establish a program no later than May 1, 2010, to provide grants to implement medication management services for the treatment of chronic diseases.

**[Page 459, Sec. 3504](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=459)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to change the wording of a few parts and add the following section.

**[Page 459, Sec. 1204](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=459)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to award at least 4 multi-year contracts to states that support pilot projects to test innovative new ways to do regional emergency care. States have to match every $3 of funds they receive with $1 of their own. Within 90 days of completing a pilot project, states are to report to the Secretary about it. This section also adds the following section.

**[Page 462, Sec. 498D](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=462)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to support research of various government agencies in emergency medical care systems and emergency medicine.

**[Page 463, Sec. 3505](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=463)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish 3 programs to award grants to Indian health facilities. The Secretary may also award grants to certain low-income trauma centers. It goes into detail as to what sort of trauma centers can get the grants and what sort of grants they can get. It also further alters the Public Health Service Act by adding the following section.

**[Page 466, Sec. 1245](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=466)** - Sets aside $100,000,000 to pay for the previous section in 2009, and ""such sums as may be necessary"" from 2010 through 2015. It also further alters the Public Health Service Act by adding the following section.

**[Page 467, Sec. 1246](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=467)** - Clarifies what ""uncompensated care costs"" means. It also further alters the Public Health Service Act by adding the following section.

**[Page 467, Sec. 1281](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=467)** - Allows states to award grants to create or strengthen trauma centers.

**[Page 469, Sec. 1282](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=469)** - Sets aside $600,000,000 to pay for the previous section in 2010 though 2015.

**[Page 469, Sec. 3506](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=469)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, to add the following section.

**[Page 469, Sec. 936](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=469)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a program to provide grants for the development of ""Patient Decision Aids"", materials to help patients and doctors to better know what their options are when there is a choice regarding different forms of treatment. These materials are to be made freely available.

**[Page 472, Sec. 3507](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=472)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study to determine whether health care decision-making would be improved by standardizing the way drug information is presented on prescription drugs. This study is to be done by 2011, and if it is determined that it would be improved, within 3 years the Secretary is to create regulation to enact that standardization.

**[Page 472, Sec. 3508](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=472)** - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for demonstration projects to medical schools that incorporate quality improvement and patient safety into their curriculum. Schools can submit proposals and, the Secretary decides if it's worth trying, and the school tracks data on the new curriculum's results. For every $5 of grant money a school gets for this, the school must contribute $1 themselves. By 2012, the Secretary is to start submitting a yearly report to Congress on what demonstration projects are underway and how well they're doing.

325,explainlikeimfive,(explainlikeimfive) : Stocks and the Stock Market Explained!,"A number of people have asked questions on ELI5 related to how stocks and stock market work. Here goes:

----

** Part One : Stocks **

First, let's imagine that down the street there is a toy store. Mr. Jones owns the toy store, and he has owned it for the last ten years. The toy store is a company which sells toys and all the kids love to get toys from Mr. Jones' toy store.

Let's suppose we wanted to buy Mr. Jones' toy store from him so that all of the kids would buy toys from us instead. Would we be able to buy it for a dollar? No, of course not. It is worth a lot more than that. How about ten dollars? A hundred dollars?

Well, how exactly would we find out how much we need to pay in order to buy Mr. Jones' toy store? The most important thing to consider is simply how much money is the toy store making. If the toy store is making $100 every day, that means it is making roughly $3,000 (30 days of $100) every month, or $36,000 every year (12 months of $3,000). Let's suppose we are able to figure that the toy store should be able to keep making this much for the next ten years. Then we could consider that the entire toy store is worth $360,000 (which is $36,000 for ten years). 

Now, in practice this is a lot more complicated. But the basic principle is simply to figure out how much money a company can be expected to make in a certain time frame. Fortunately, we don't have to figure it out ourselves. There are big companies whose job is to figure out how much other companies are worth, and they do all of the hard work for us. They will tell us just how much Mr. Jones' toy store is really worth, and then we can decide to buy it or not.

So, let's consider that the toy store is worth $360,000. If we want to buy it (and if he is willing to sell it), we can pay Mr. Jones that much money and now the toy store is ours!

Now, this is all well and good if we have $360,000 and we want to own the entire company. But let's suppose we only have half that much, we have $180,000. What can we do now? Well, as long as Mr. Jones is willing, we can buy *half* of his company instead of the whole thing.

This means that we will own 50% or half of the company, and he will own the other half. That means that instead of all of the money from selling toys going to Mr. Jones, half will go to him and the other half to us. 

Another way of saying that we own 50% of the company is to say that we own 50% of the stock in a company. When a company is set up in a way that you can buy pieces of it, those pieces are called stock. There are two ways to think about stock: percentages, and shares.

What we just talked about are percentages. We can buy 50% of the shares in Mr. Jones' toy company for $180,000. Similarly, we could buy 10% of the shares in Mr. Jones' toy company for $36,000 (assuming the total value of the company was $360,000), or we could buy 1% of the shares for $3,600, and so on.

When you hear people talk about stocks, you will hear them talk about shares of stock. What exactly does this mean? Well, let's imagine that Mr. Jones has a lot of people who want to buy a piece of his company. What he can do is say ""Hey everyone, I have 100 different pieces of my company for sale.""

In this example, there are 100 total pieces he has for sale, each one being worth 1% of the stock. To buy all 100 pieces would cost you $360,000 and this would mean you own the entire company. This would mean that whenever the company makes money, you get all of the money. But let's suppose we only have $3,600 to use. This means all we can afford is *one* piece of his company, but that one piece is worth 1% which means that every time the company makes a hundred dollars, we will get one dollar.

So in this example, Mr. Jones' looks at the situation and realizes it is very hard to find people to buy pieces of his company, because each piece costs $3,600 which is a lot of money. So he decides rather than just have 100 pieces, or shares, he is going to have a thousand pieces! Now it takes ten shares to have 1% of the company, but each share is only $360. That is a lot more affordable. He could even decide to make 10,000 shares which means that you could buy a share for only $36.

So this is the basic concept. Companies cut their value into pieces, or shares, and then sell the shares to people who will buy them. The people who buy shares are called ""investors"" and the act of buying a share is called ""investing"". This means that they are buying shares in a company because they think that eventually they will make back more than what they paid, because they are getting a piece of all of the money that the company makes.

When a company is enormous, worth billions of dollars, even a thousand shares is simply not enough. They need to have many, many shares in order to make sure that shares are affordable. Some companies have millions of shares of stock.

Now, we have covered one aspect of what it means to own stock in a company. You are able to keep some of the money the company makes, based on how many shares you own. But when you own part of a company, you don't just get some of the money it makes. You also get to make decisions. Everyone who has shares in a company has the right to vote for what the company will do next. The amount of voting power you have is equal to the percentage of shares you have. 

Imagine that a company is owned by three people: Billy, Melissa, and James. Imagine that Billy owns 40% of the total shares, and that Melissa and James each own 30%, which is less than what Billy owns. 

Let's suppose that the toy company is trying to decide whether to sell a certain toy. Billy thinks it is a good idea, but Melissa and James think it is a bad idea. Well, even though Billy has more shares of stock in the company, and more voting power, he will still be *out voted* by both Melissa and James. This is because together Melissa and James have 60% compared to Billy's 40%. 

When a company has a lot of share holders (people who own stock in the company), they will have meetings called shareholder meetings. In these meetings, everyone gets to vote based on the shares they own. The company will do whatever the prevailing vote decides.

So then, this brings up a question. What if there are a lot of people who own shares, but one of them owns more than half of all the shares? Would that person be able to out-vote everyone else, no matter how many other people there are? 

The answer is yes. If a single person owns more than half of all the shares, then they have what is called ""controlling interest"" in the company. This means that they can decide anything for the company and outvote everyone else. 

----

** Part Two : The Stock Market **

So by now you should have a pretty good idea of what stock is. Now let's imagine that there is also a video game company owned by Mr. Smith. Now, Mr. Smith's company is doing a lot better than Mr. Jones'. We had said that Mr. Jones' company is worth $360,000 based on how much it is expected to make over ten years, but Mr. Smith's is worth twice that! His video game company is worth $720,000. 

Let's imagine that Mr. Jones' company has 100 total shares of stock, each valued at $3,600 per share. Let's also imagine that Mr. Smith's company also has 100 total shares of stock, each valued at $7,200 per share. This means that if we had $7,200 we could choose to either buy two shares in Mr. Jones' toy company, or one share in Mr. Smith's video game company. 

Let's suppose that we already own two shares of stock in Mr. Jones' toy company. Our two shares are worth $7,200 which is enough to buy one share of stock in Mr. Smith's company. We looked at both companies, and we decided that Mr. Smith's company seems like it is doing the best, so we decide to sell our two shares in Mr. Jones' toy company, and buy one share of stock in Mr. Smith's company. And this is the basics of stock trading.

Now here is where things get interesting. How much a company is really worth *changes* constantly. Mr. Jones' company has been making $100 every day for ten years, but all of last year his company was only making $50 per day! Is it still worth $360,000 ? Maybe it is losing value, or maybe it is just going through a rough period. If we owned stock in the company, we would have to decide which it is. If we decide the company is losing value, then we will probably want to sell our stocks and buy stocks in a company that is doing better. 

There are a *lot* of reasons to assume that a company is doing better, or worse. We might have heard a rumor that Mr. Jones' toy company, even though it has only been making $50/day is about to start selling a really, really cool toy. We say ""Wow, if he sells that toy lots of kids will buy it!"" and so we decide to buy a lot of stock because we think that the stock is actually worth more than Mr. Jones says. 

Similarly, we might have heard a rumor that an even better toy company is going to be opening up a store right next door to Mr. Jones' toy store. In this case, we might say ""Oh no, we have a lot of shares of stock in Mr. Jones' toy company, and we better sell it fast! If we don't, we will lose money because the kids will all shop at the new toy store instead."" You can see that emotion plays a big role in this.  

Now let's imagine that instead of two companies (Mr. Jones' Toy Company, and Mr. Smith's Video Game Company), there are hundreds of companies. Let's also imagine there are thousands of people all trading stock in each company at the same time. Now you have what is called a stock exchange. If you take the value of *all* of the companies and add them together, and then divide that by the total number of companies in your stock exchange, you get an average that you can track over time to see how well on average all of the companies are doing.

Let's suppose that all of the companies combined are worth a million dollars, and that there are only ten total companies in the stock exchange. Then we would say that the average value is a million divided by ten which is $100,000. Remember though that how much companies are worth changes over time, so the very next day it might turn out that all ten companies combined are now worth two million dollars, which means our average is now $200,000. 

If we keep track of this average over time, we can create a graph. We can watch this graph to get a good feel for how the companies in the stock exchange are doing. This can also help us decide whether or not investing in more companies is a good idea, or a bad idea. 

There you have it, the basics of stocks and the stock market. I hope you enjoyed it.

2. A committee will be made which needs to plan more cuts by November. None of the drastic thing the parties wanted- taxing the rich for democrats, and cuts to entitlements for republicans-have been made yet. The parties and the president hope the committee will decide to do these things.

Glossary-
A default would mean our government wouldn't be able to pay it's debts. This would make investors feel like we wouldn't be able to pay them, and would pull out, which would be bad for our economy.
Entitlements are government programs like Medicare or social security- when the government gives money to people/pays things for them (including when citizens pay for it gradually throughout their lives)"

417,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is Flamboyantly Gay an accent?,"As in, why is there a tone of voice and inflection that is very likely that of a gay person? I obviously realize that not all gay people sound the same, but there is a very stereotypical sound that you can pick out of a crowd if you hear it. I don't know anything about linguistics, but I'm having trouble wrapping my brain around a culture that's so decentralized, and until very recently, so held back from being public without persecution, having this shared, almost unmistakable quality.

420,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does American fuel have less octane than European fuel? Aren't we driving sort of the same models that should require the same kind of fuel?,"e.g. I live in Germany and our *Premium* fuel has 100 octane, regular has 95.

426,explainlikeimfive,PSA: A friendly note about reposts,"I've been noticing a lot of reposted questions recently, mostly about things like Megaupload and other current events, but more than that, I've been going into threads I find interesting and curious and finding the only replies that have been posted are telling the OP to search before asking.

This is good, we don't want too much recycled content on this sub or to be spammed with the same questions a thousand times a day (like what happened the last few days with Megaupload questions), **however, when I check the links provided by commenters telling the OP to search first, most of the posts I see (that are the same as or similar to the post being commented on) are several months or more old.**

**I just want to let everyone know that it is okay to have the same question asked that was asked six months or a year ago.** Chances are, most of us didn't see it, or if we did, we could use a refresher on the topic since it was so long ago.

By-and-large, everything's been great, keep posting great questions and answers, and don't forget to be awesome!

427,explainlikeimfive,I'm concerned that ELI5 is essentially becoming AskReddit,"**EDIT**: The title should also include r/answers. As pointed out by demondawid, what ELI5 is in danger of becoming is more like r/answers than AskReddit. I think AskReddit still applies to my point, but far less so than r/answers. The concern is still the same though. This subreddit serves a niche, and it's a very specific one. I hope it can steer towards it, and stay there.

Here's my concern. Many people are taking the ""like I'm five"" idea to be metaphorical. A cute way of saying, ""explain it to me in a simple way."" As I understand it, the idea is to not only explain the idea simply, but to explain it in a way a child *could* grasp. It gives someone completely clueless the fundamentals of understanding, which he can then build off of. If you look at AskReddit (r/answers fits here as well), it is essentially a place where people who don't know about a thing, or want to know more about a thing, get it explained to them in a simple way, a way they can understand. I've seen answers in this subreddit that could easily have been in AskReddit OR r/answers.

People say that explaining some concepts that simply is impossible. I was inclined to agree, but then I saw [**this**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2ekw/how_did_we_go_from_binary_to_assembly_language_to/c28n0cr). Amazing. It was an easy read, and gave me the basic understanding of something that I thought would be too complex to explain to a child. Unfortunately, [**this**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2ekw/how_did_we_go_from_binary_to_assembly_language_to/c28l6by) is more highly upvoted. I looked at that and saw a bunch of numbers and acronyms and thought, ""ugh, never mind. I'm not really that interested in programming."" I'm sure it's well thought out, and very informative, but it doesn't follow the spirit of this subreddit. I downvoted the latter comment, and upvoted the first one I linked to (chipbuddy's). I realise this is against reddiquette, but it makes sense in this subreddit. I don't mind that those comments exist, I just wish that people realise why this subreddit was created and relegate comments like that a little bit lower. Perhaps after I read chipbuddy's very well child-tailored explanation, I would be more inclined to read the more complicated one. We need to self-moderate a little bit better.

TL;DR - AskReddit and r/answers are for straightforward and/or simple explanations. ELI5 is for explanations a child *could* understand.

Edited to include r/answers due to demonawid's critique. He's right, but I believe my point is still valid.

**Edit 2**: I love that we have a lot of discussion going on this. I've been busy today, so I haven't had time to join in as much as I'd like. I hear those who are disagreeing with me, you all have valid points. However, I do want to make one thing clear. I am not suggesting that a child couldn't comprehend what a kind of metal is or what a certain element is called. If you explain it to Eli in the right way, he'd definitely comprehend it. The ""right way"" is what I'm getting at. I believe my fist linked comment explaining programming languages is not the right way to explain it to Eli. It does not need to be an analogy, but that certainly helps with very complicated answers.

**To those who believe that I, and the others who agree, are being overly nit picky**: If this subreddit involves people asking questions and getting answers [like these](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2ekw/how_did_we_go_from_binary_to_assembly_language_to/c28l6by), how is it any different from r/answers? To remain distinct, this subreddit has to stay in the ""a child *could* comprehend it"" niche.

**Edit 3**: It looks as if chipbuddy's response has surged up since I linked to those two responses above. Good on you all!"

While there are no ""dumb"" questions here, please don't waste the space by asking questions that are clearly rhetorical in nature.

438,explainlikeimfive,"When I ""google"" passwords I use for various websites (usually porn) I get lots of hits for databases that include both my username and password - wtf?","This is nothing new...I've noticed it happening for years.  Some of the usernames and passwords I use for certain websites (admittedly, they are usually porn) somehow end up in general circulation.  If I google them I can often (not always, but often) find them embedded in lists of other usernames and passwords.  They typically have the corresponding URL as well.  How do people get their hands on these?  I don't share them and I don't think it's related to a virus or spyware or whatever on my comp because it's happened for years and I've had numerous comps during that time.

EDIT: lol, several people seem perplexed that I would pay for porn when so much of it can be found for free on the net.

502,explainlikeimfive,"A note from your friendly, ELI5 mods: Please, no more meta, ""what ELI5 is/isn't"" posts or arguments. We'll be removing them.","Hey guys! Just wanted to say a few words here.

In just a few months, ELI5 has turned from a crazy, middle-of-the-night idea I had during this past summer off from teaching...into an explosively popular subreddit that's now bigger than I had ever hoped (hitting 50,000 subscribers a few weeks ago.) I'm still amazed by that -- but I'm even more amazed at what an amazing community this has become, and how much knowledge is being shared. This could not have been possible without all you amazing subscribers -- as well as our truly dedicated and fantastic mod staff. I'd dare anyone to browse around ELI5 for twenty minutes and not come away having learned something new - or been taught to think of something in a new way. That's pretty awesome.

Having said that, I want to clarify what myself and the rest of the mods believe ELI5 exactly is and is not. And while we understand that the idea and subreddit itself will continue to grow and evolve, there are some things we would like to clarify:

-- As we say in the sidebar, ELI5 is a place to receive simple explanations to complicated issues. ""Simple explanations"" **does NOT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE an allegory or metaphor.** (However, if this works best for the explanation, great!) Point is: *As long as the explanation is simple and as thorough as possible, it belongs in ELI5.*

-- A word about the whole ""five-year-old"" thing: Yes, I named this place ""Explain Like I'm Five"", but really, it's more of a title to be catchy. **Please, please stop arguing about what a five-year-old would understand...or would ask about.** We all know most five-year-olds wouldn't ask questions about politics, or sex, or economics -- but those are some of our best posts, and fall wholly within the spirit of ELI5. Believe me, I work on a campus where there are actual five-year-olds running around, and trust that you would NOT want this subreddit to be dominated by those kinds of questions (or answers.)

-- For goodness sakes, if you disagree with a submission, please use the downvote button. We don't need to continue the infighting about what belongs here and what doesn't. If you disagree with the LOGIC behind an *answer*, please feel free to reply with a rebuttal! But...we don't need to argue here and be uncivilized. It's ""Explain Like I'm Five""...not Act Like I'm Five.

Remember, subreddits work because they're ultimately controlled by YOU, the community. YOU ultimately decide -- via upvotes and downvotes -- what's good content and what isn't. It's not our job as mods to police you -- and you honestly don't need it. You've proven yourselves to be an incredibly intelligent community. The VAST majority of content in ELI5 is awesome, in terms of both questions and answers. This is, at its heart, a place to ask questions without fear of judgment or ridicule. That means ANY question. Think it's better suited for AskReddit, another subreddit or maybe not even Reddit at all? Cool. Downvote and move on. I say again: **If you don't like a submission, downvote and move on.** Enough infighting. Allow the system to work. It really, truly does as a whole.

On another note -- **if you LOVE  a submission or answer, don't forget to submit it into our ongoing compilation**, [""The Five Year Old's Guide To The Galaxy!](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ldbf4/calling_all_fiveyearolds_submit_your_favorite/) You can find a link to submit and view in the sidebar any time you visit ELI5.

I want to thank those of you who have contacted us recently and asked for a statement such as this to go out -- as well as those of you who've made the meta posts to begin with, too. Your mods will always be here to listen to each of you who've made this place so great, and hopefully this note lets you know that our non-interventionist stance on most posts does NOT mean we're not keeping an eye on this place. We're right here, loving this subreddit as much as the crazy day it started. We appreciate every message and every post, and will continue to strive to do our best to keep ELI5 a place of learning and discovery.

**To that end: As of today, we will be removing any meta, ""what is the nature of ELI5"" posts. Questions -- and the occasional ""unsolicited explanation"" posts -- only, please.**

I hope this note has cleared up things a little, our mission, our goals, all of that. As always, feel free to message the mods as a whole or me personally if you have any questions or comments.

**Thank you guys for being kick-ass ELI5'ers.**

With gratitude,

513,explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why do some other land mammals (like dogs) instinctively know how to swim, but humans have to be taught?  ","Never really made sense to me. You put a 6 month old puppy in the water and BAM! he/she can just cruise around no problem. Put a 8 year old or an 18 year old in the water for the first time and they could very easily drown.

Edit 1: There are so many different theories as to why dogs can swim and why babies ~~can~~ ~~cannot~~ can? I think I'm more confused now then when I first posted....

Edit 2: People seem to be arguing about ""thrashing about to stay afloat"" vs actual ""swimming"". My point is that if you put a dog out in a lake for the first time they could probably swim to shore and get out, but a human would probably just trash about and have trouble (at the very least) treading water."

It's also interesting to note that we all have different variations of sticking out our tongue. Some of us move them around, while others chew on them or simply stick them out. Additionally, I found that some things I would expect to trigger this for me don't, while others do.

Thompson, etc. They are known drug abusers, and what's more, they don't even try to keep it a secret. In a country where you can be locked away in a slammer for years for possession, it seems very unfair and incongruous to see that the same standard is not applied to famous persons. Usually, the worst that they get is getting forced into rehab. Is it the privilege of their fame? Money? Influence? "

595,explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why reddit auto-downvotes?,"**Answered**:   
&gt;It is to stop people from using bots to up vote their own posts. What it does specifically is stops them from knowing if their vote has been ignored or not.
If they had a bot, and up-voted a post, and the post number stayed the same. Then it would be obvious that the bot was ignored and then they could work towards circumventing it.
&gt;However, if instead of just ignoring it, it gives the post one up-vote and one down-vote. They wouldn't be able to tell if someone just down voted it, or if it was the number fuzzing program.
&gt;So put simply:
&gt;It constantly moves the numbers around so you can't tell if your vote actually counted or not, but it totally does count unless you have blocked by spam protection.

Anyone want to suggest exceptional answers to these or any other *frequently* asked questions that they've come across, and then maybe we can bug the mods to add them into the FAQ?

Oh my, so many questions. And they wanted citations... so I went and looked up page numbers in the actual document. And as I read it, I started thinking... what if I just go down the bill and talk about each section, in order, in a way that a layman might be able to understand?

It's a huge undertaking. The [current version of the bill](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf) is 974 pages long. Yikes! However, I think that by summarizing and simplifying, we can whittle that down to something more manageable. But it's going to take a while to do it. Maybe a week. Maybe more. If enough people are interested, I'll keep adding to this until I'm finished.

So, without further ado, here goes...

(**Note: I am NOT an expert! I'm just a guy. If I have made an error on any of this, please let me know!**)

(**Note: Unlike my previous post, for the sake of clarity and continuity, any references to page numbers will be referring to the PDF file, not the page number in the document**)

**[Page 1](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=1)** - Title page

**[Page 2](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=2)** - Disclaimers 'n stuff. Technically, this is a condensed version of the bill. I guess the actual legal version has a lot more legalese... or something.

**[Pages 3-32](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=3)** - Table of Contents

**[Page 32, Sec. 1001](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=32)** - Alters another bill (The Public Health Service Act), just to make room for the additions this bill is going to make. So when you read that other bill, it makes sense and doesn't look like a bunch of stuff was just tacked on at the end.

**[Page 33, Sec. 2711](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33)** - Says that insurers can't have lifetime limits on the amount of care customers can get, and that starting in 2014, they can't have yearly limits either. So you get as much care as you need.

**[Page 33, Sec. 2712](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33)** - No more ""rescissions"". In other words, Insurers can't just drop customers once they get sick. The only time they can drop a customer is if that customer commits fraud.

**[Page 33, Sec. 2713](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33)** - Insurance plans need to include preventive care (colonoscopies, mammagrams, immunizations, etc.) without any extra costs (like co-pays). I should note that this section also includes something that led to a bit of controversy - It says that health insurance must include preventive care for women supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. And the Health Resources and Services Administration, on the recommendation of the independent Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science, has determined that preventive care for women should include access to, amongst other things, contraception. Insurers *must* provide these services, and *cannot* require a copay for them. They are paid for by the insurance company. On February 10, 2012 (or February 15th, if you go by the header in the document), the Department of Health and Human Services issued [this](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-02-15/pdf/2012-3547.pdf) document, detailing its enforcement of this section. It clarifies that churches are exempt from being required to provide coverage for contraception, and that insurers are to create plans specifically for religiously-owned businesses, like Catholic hospitals, so that employees still get contraceptive coverage through their employer without *any* of the costs being paid by the employer *or* the employee.

**[Page 34, Sec. 2714](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=34)** - Insurance plans need to cover dependents up to the age of 26

**[Page 35, Sec. 2715](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=35)** - A year after the law was passed, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would need to get together with National Association of Insurance Commissioners to establish standards for the insurance industry. This is basically to make sure that everyone is using the same terms, the same language, and is providing the same information to customers, so customers have a better idea how to compare one policy to another.

**[Page 37, Sec. 2715A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=37)** - From now on, insurers must, in a clear, easy-to-understand format, make a bunch of information public: What their policies are, how many people are using their plans, how many claims they deny, financial information, etc.

**[Page 37, Sec. 2716](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=37)** - Refers to rules in another document, the Internal Revenue Code, but it looks like it's just making sure insurers don't give preferential treatment to rich people. I'm guessing this means a more expensive plan might cover more stuff, but wouldn't let the rich guy cut ahead of you in line at the doctor's office. Or something.

**[Page 38, Sec. 2717](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=38)** - 2 years after the law passed, the Secretary of Health and Human Services needs to establish rules for how insurers will report, on a yearly basis, the quality of care given under their plans, to be made available to the public online. This includes stuff relating to wellness and prevention programs (healthy eating, anti-smoking, etc.), as well as a big section making it clear that customers aren't supposed to be asked about gun ownership (in case someone thinks it might be a good idea to factor that into their reporting).

**[Page 40, Sec. 2718](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=40)** - Insurance companies need to make public how much they spend on insurance claims, and what they make in profits. Starting in 2011, if their costs (and risks, and overhead, etc.) is less than 80-85% of the money they make, they need to send rebates out to their customers. Basically, they're not allowed to do price-gouging to make obscene profits.

**[Page 42, Sec. 2719](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=42)** - Insurers need to offer customers the ability to appeal a claim that was denied. This appeal process will be monitored under an external review process to make sure it's doing what it's supposed to.

**[Page 43, Sec. 2719A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=43)** - Makes sure that customers can decide their own doctors, and that if their insurance covers emergency care, customers can go to any emergency room without having to worry whether their insurance will cover that specific emergency room. Basically, this section insures that customers still have freedom of choice where they get their medical care.

**[Page 46, Sec. 1002](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=46)** - Adds the next part to a different bill, the Public Health Service Act

**[Page 46, Sec. 2793](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=46)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services will offer grants to states so that the states can have a Consumer Service programs that will investigate problems customers have with insurance, help to spread information, answer questions, and help to facilitate appeals processes.

**[Page 47, Sec. 1003](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=47)** - Adds the next part to a different bill, the Public Health Service Act

**[Page 47, Sec. 2794](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=47)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide what constitutes an ""unreasonable"" increase in premiums, and conduct an annual review of increases in premiums to look for these. Insurers must explain their reasons for any such unreasonable increases *before* making them, and must make this information available to the public. If any insurer increases premiums too much or too fast, it may be dropped from ""exchange"" programs (more on this later).

**[Page 49, Sec. 1004](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=49)** - This is just detailing when some of the earlier stuff should happen. It's already all done.

**[Page 49, Sec. 1101](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=49)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services will make a ""high-risk pool"" insurance program for people with pre-existing conditions, to make sure they can get insurance right now. The program ends in 2014 (because in 2014, insurers can't refuse anyone with a pre-existing condition).

**[Page 52, Sec. 1102](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=52)** - Gives a reimbursement to insurance plans that provide health insurance for early retirees

**[Page 55, Sec. 1103](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=55)** - Create a website ( [http://www.healthcare.gov/](http://www.healthcare.gov/) ) to help people find health insurance in their state, and give them information about options available to them.

**[Page 56, Sec. 1104](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=56)** - Making changes to a few other bills, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the Social Security Act, to add definitions and clarify the wording in some sections, and to specify that the paperwork people have to fill out should be clear, concise, and easy-to-understand, as well as to incorporate the use of medical cards used with electronic databases. Basically, this whole section is changing the wording in a few other bills so that all of the bills make things simple and easy for people to fill out paperwork (or simply use a medical card) at hospitals and stuff. Any health plans that don't follow these new rules for clarity will have to pay a fee.

**[Page 63, Sec. 1105](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=63)** - This is just detailing when some of the earlier stuff should happen. It's already all done.

**[Page 64, Sec. 1201](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=64)** - This one is changing another bill, the Public Health Service Act, by adding in the following section.

**[Page 64, Sec. 2704](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=64)** - Starting in 2014, No more turning people down due to ""pre-existing conditions"". This is already in effect (as of 6 months after this bill passed) for anyone under the age of 19.

**[Page 65, Sec. 2701](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=65)** - Starting in 2014, the only things about you that insurers can take into consideration when determining your premium rates are whether you want to cover your family or just you, what your age is, whether or not you use tobacco, and other factors to be determined by each state (unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services believes a state's ""rating area"" to be inadequate, in which that rating area may be changed).

**[Page 65, Sec. 2702](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=65)** - Starting in 2014, Insurers must accept *everyone* who applies for coverage.

**[Page 66, Sec. 2703](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=66)** - Starting in 2014, Insurers must renew coverage for everyone who has it.

**[Page 66, Sec. 2705](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=66)** - Starting in 2014, Insurers can't restrict you from getting a plan based on past illnesses, genetic history, a disability, previous health care you've gotten, because you were the victim of domestic violence... basically, your personal health history is off-limits when it comes to insurers deciding what plans you can apply for.

**[Page 70, Sec. 2706](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=70)** - Starting in 2014, If a doctor or hospital is willing to work with an insurer, the insurer has to let them.

**[Page 71, Sec. 2707](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=71)** - Reiterating that the plans offered have to cover the stuff specified by the other sections of this bill.

**[Page 71, Sec. 2708](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=71)** - Starting in 2014, Waiting periods can't be longer than 90 days.

**[Page 71, Sec. 2709](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=71)** - This has to do with ""Clinical Trials"", stuff that's not ready for mass use yet, and that is still being tested. Basically, it's saying that starting in 2014, people should have access to that sort of trial if they want, and that their insurer shouldn't be able to screw with their insurance plans because they choose to participate in one.

**[Page 74, Sec. 1251](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=74)** - Says that when this law passed, no one had to change their plans. They could if they wanted, but they could totally keep their current plan if they like it.

**[Page 75, Sec. 1252](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=75)** - Says that the changes this law makes apply to *all* health plans companies offer, not just some.

**[Page 75, Sec. 1253](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=75)** - The Secretary of Labor needs to make a yearly report to Congress on self-insured employers.

**[Page 76, Sec. 1254](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=76)** - A year after this law passes, The Secretary of Health and Human Services needs to write a report on group health plans.

**[Page 76, Sec. 1255](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=76)** - You know the dozen or so ""In 2014""s I've put in a bunch of the recent bullet-points? Well, this is the part that specified they happen in 2014, with the exception of a few parts that start sooner.

**[Page 77, Sec. 1301](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=77)** - This section talks about what a plan needs to be in order to be ""qualified"" (basically, okay for an insurer to sell). It needs to be certified for the requirements of the insurance exchange it's going to be in (more on the exchanges later), it needs to have the features described in the next section, needs to be sold by a licensed insurer, needs to be sold at the same rate regardless of whether it's sold directly or in an exchange, etc.

**[Page 78, Sec. 1302](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=78)** - The last section talked about what a plan needs to be, but this one talks about what needs to be *in* it. And that's a lot of ground to cover, so bear with me. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is going to determine what the minimum levels need to be for everything, but this section outlines that by saying that health insurance plans must cover bare minimums of ambulatory services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health services, drugs, rehabilitative services, laboratory services, preventative services, and pediatric services that include oral and vision care. This section also goes into detail on just how the Secretary is to determine those minimum levels (be mindful of different types of people, be balanced, etc.). This section *also* limits how big deductibles can get starting in 2015 (no bigger than $2000 for individuals and $4000 for couples). On top of that, this establishes that plans should fall into Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum levels, with each corresponding to a different level of benefits. For Bronze, insurers pay for 60% of the costs of the benefits, Silver is 70%, Gold is 80% and Platinum is 90%. A plan that's not one of those could still be okay if it's a Catastrophic plan, which is only for people under 30 or with special tax exemptions, and it only has to cover three primary care visits. Additionally, any plan created for adults must also be available for children under 18.

Whew! That was a long one! Okay, let's move on...

**[Page 83, Sec. 1303](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=83)** - A state may choose to fund plans that include abortion coverage, or they may not. It's up to each state to decide that. Basically, the folks who wrote the bill knew what a hot-button issue abortion was, and they wrote this section to pass the buck on to state lawmakers without siding one way or another.

**[Page 87, Sec. 1304](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=87)** - This section defines a bunch of terms.

Okay, now we're about to get into health insurance exchanges, which allow plans to compete across different areas. The idea, if I'm getting this right, is that by having more insurance companies competing across a larger area, prices will be driven down due to competition. As I understand it, this is what they ultimately ended up doing instead of having a ""public option"" (optional state-run insurance to compete with the others). Since the public option got shot down before the bill was passed, this was seen as another way to encourage more competition in the market.

It bears mention, that in the 6/28/12 [Supreme Court ruling](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf) on this bill, it was declared that states are not required to establish health insurance exchanges, and that they cannot be penalized for refusing to do so by reducing the funding they get for Medicare and Medicaid. However, if any states choose to opt-out of the creation of these exchanges, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources may simply create the exchanges for those states directly (or even go as far as to create a multi-state exchange encompassing any number of states that refuse to create their own). This is just speculation, of course, but in any case, the court decision shouldn't greatly impact the creation of these exchanges.

**[Page 88, Sec. 1311](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=88)** - Another big one. This section sets aside money to the states so they can start up health insurance exchanges. The Secretary of Health and Human Services determines how much to keep giving the states based on how much progress they're making. States only have until 2015 to get their act together, though - after that they get no money. However, states *must* have something ready by 2014. States can choose to require insurers to have benefits that go above and beyond what this law requires, but they have to figure out how to pay for anything they come up with that requires more government money. by 2015, the exchanges need to be self-funding. States can even team up to make multi-state exchanges if they want.

**[Page 99, Sec. 1312](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=99)** - Individuals can get any plan they qualify for. If you qualify for it, you can get it, if you don't, you can't. This section seems to be talking about different ways people can get insurance (through employment, through a broker, etc.), and making sure they get it. Also, Congress has to make use of the same plans us ordinary taxpayers have.

**[Page 102, Sec. 1313](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=102)** - States need to keep track of the money these insurance exchanges are using, make sure they're working right financially, and watch out for fraud.

**[Page 104, Sec. 1321](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=104)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services is to set the standards that these insurance exchanges are supposed to follow. If any state fails to follow them satisfactorily, fails to get it set up in time, or chooses not to do it at all, the Secretary will set one up for them.

**[Page 105, Sec. 1322](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=105)** - This sets up the rules, as well as instructions for loans and grants, for the creation of non-profit, member-run insurers called Co-ops. Basically, what credit unions are to banks, this aims to be for traditional insurance companies. This section aims to make it easier for a bunch of people to band together to start their own non-profit insurance company to provide insurance all the people who banded together. The idea is to give people more options, and more competition in the market.

**[Page 111, Sec. 1323](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=111)** - This option is stricken and no longer exists. Looks like it was probably the public option back before it was kicked off of this bill.

**[Page 111, Sec. 1323 (same number, different section) ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=111)** - Allocates money specifically for territories that aren't states, like Puerto Rico.

**[Page 112, Sec. 1324](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=112)** - This says that Co-ops have to work under the same laws as normal insurance companies.

**[Page 112, Sec. 1331](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=112)** - This allows the government to create a low-cost insurance option for people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but who still make less than 200% of the poverty line (which is a number that depends on your age and how many are in your household, but this amount, at its lowest is a little over $20,000/year).

**[Page 117, Sec. 1332](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=117)** - If any state can come up with their own plan, one which gives citizens the same level of care at the same price as the PPACA, they can ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services for permission to do their plan instead of the PPACA. So if they can get the same results without, say, the mandate, they can be allowed to do so. Vermont, for example, has expressed a desire to just go straight to single-payer.

**[Page 119, Sec. 1333](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=119)** - In 2013, states can work with insurers to allow them to make plans available in multiple states with different laws and regulations

**[Page 120, Sec. 1334](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=120)** - A different way for an insurer to do a multi-state plan.

**[Page 124, Sec. 1341](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=124)** - Starting in 2014, states must either create or work with an already-existing non-profit reinsurance agency. Reinsurance agencies basically buy insurance plans from insurers when they are deemed to be high-risk. This helps to keep premiums for other customers down, since otherwise insurers would have to raise prices to offset that risk. This section talks about some of the rules for these sorts of agencies. 50-100 medical conditions are to be identified as high-risk conditions that insurers can offer up to reinsurance agencies. Partly to offset the risk these agencies are taking by taking on these high-risk customers, reinsurers are tax-exempt.

**[Page 127, Sec. 1342](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=127)** - In 2014-2016, the government will create ""Risk corridors"", basically saying that in the first few years while insurers adjust to all these new rules, the government will help with some of the risk associated with insurance payouts.

**[Page 128, Sec. 1343](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=128)** - Each state will charge insurers who take on less risk, and make payments to insurers who take more risk, acting as an equalizer so that the companies that succeed aren't just the ones who cater mostly to demographics with a low amount of risk.

**[Page 129, Sec. 1401](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=129)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding the following section.

**[Page 129, Sec. 36B](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=129)** - Starting in 2014, gives a refundable tax credit to everyone who makes too much to qualify for Medicaid, but makes less than 400% of the poverty line (which, again, is based on your age and how many people are in your household). Depending on how much you make, this could save you up to $10,000 a year. A refundable tax credit is basically a discount on your taxes, and if it's more money than you pay in taxes, you actually get the extra money back as a refund. This is the bill's answer to the question ""How will I afford insurance if I make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford insurance on my own?"".

**[Page 138, Sec. 1402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=138)** - If I'm reading this right, insurers must reduce costs (both co-pays and overall costs) for everyone who makes too much to qualify for Medicaid, but makes less than 400% of the poverty line (which, like I said last time, is based on your age and how many people are in your household). Depending on how much you make, your co-pay costs could be slashed by up to two-thirds the normal price, and your overall costs could be covered up to 94%. If you're an Indian (presumably Native American Indian) making under 300% of the poverty line, you have no co-pay. This section specifically says it only applies to citizens and legal aliens living in the US (so no illegal aliens allowed)

**[Page 142, Sec. 1411](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=142)** - It looks like this section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up a way to check whether people are eligible to buy insurance. It looks like it's basically, in a roundabout way, trying to keep illegal aliens from being qualified for insurance, and setting up penalties for anyone who lies on insurance forms.

**[Page 150, Sec. 1412](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=150)** - This section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up a way to check whether people are eligible for the tax credits and the insurance cost reductions (that ""up to 400%"" stuff). Basically, instructing him to set up a system to determine what people qualify for based on their income. And also, no illegal aliens.

**[Page 152, Sec. 1413](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=152)** - This section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up standard forms and enrollment procedures for state-level programs like Medicaid and Child Health programs.

**[Page 154, Sec. 1414](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=154)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services is allowed to share relevant tax information with those who need it in order to verify what people qualify for.

**[Page 156, Sec. 1415](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=156)** - All these tax credits and refunds won't count as income. So they won't be taxed or anything.

**[Page 156, Sec. 1416](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=156)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services is instructed to conduct a study into the possibility of adjusting poverty levels based on where people live. Because making $30,000/year in rural Kansas is a hell of a lot different than making $30,000/year in San Francisco.

**[Page 157, Sec. 1421](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=157)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding the following section.

**[Page 157, Sec. 45R](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=157)** - Businesses with 25 or fewer employees can get a tax credit worth up to 50% of the cost of the health care they provide their employees.

The following parts deal with ""The Requirement to Maintain Minimal Essential Coverage"", AKA ""The Mandate"". This is one of the big parts that people have taken issue with, and the very same one that the Supreme Court [recently ruled](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf) *is* constitutional (as long as it's seen as a tax and not a penalty, for all those lawyer-types out there).

**[Page 162, Sec. 1501](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=162)** - This is a big, fat, explanation for the reasons behind The Mandate. Basically, without the mandate, people might just decide not to pay for insurance, which places a huge risk not just on themselves, but the hospitals who will eventually have to treat them when they get sick or injured. The economy loses a ton of money due to uninsured people needing emergency care, which in turn makes insurance premiums more expensive as that cost is passed on. What's more, medical expenses account for 62% of bankruptcies, which introduces even more stress into the economy. And with this bill getting rid of ""pre-existing conditions"", if there was no mandate, people would just wait to buy insurance until they need it, which pretty much defeats the whole point of insurance. In addition, requiring people to get insurance will make millions of people healthier and live longer. Besides, the more healthy people who have insurance, the less of a risk insurers are taking, which lowers everyone's prices.

**[Page 164, Sec. 5000A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=164)** - This is the actual mandate. If you can afford healthcare (if it costs less than 8% of your income), but don't get it, you will be hit in your tax return with an annual tax of $95, or up to 1% of income, whichever is greater. This will rise to $695, or 2.5% of income, by 2016. This section makes an exception for those with religious exemptions (the Amish), members of Indian tribes, and prison inmates. It also specifies that no one's going to be charged with any crime or anything, it's just a new tax if you don't comply.

**[Page 171, Sec. 6055](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=171)** - Insurers need to tell the government who they're insuring, either directly or through employers, in which case they need to tell the government which employer they're working through too.

**[Page 173, Sec. 1511](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=173)** - This one is changing another bill, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, by adding in the following section.

**[Page 173, Sec. 18A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=173)** - If an employer has over 200 employees, and offers a health plan to those employees, new employees will be automatically signed up for that health plan, though employees can opt-out if they don't want it.

**[Page 173, Sec. 1512](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=173)** - This one is changing another bill, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, by adding in the following section.

**[Page 173, Sec. 18B](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=173)** - Employers need to notify new employees about their options with health insurance exchanges and tax credits.

**[Page 174, Sec. 1513](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=174)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding the following section.

**[Page 174, Sec. 4980H](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=174)** - Starting in 2014, if an employer has over 50 full-time employees and doesn't offer them insurance, the employer has to pay a fee of $2000/year per employee. If they employ part-time employees, their hours are to be added together to see how many full-time employees they'd represent (in other words, it's not a simple head count). The Secretary of Labor is to conduct a report to see what effect this has on employees' wages.

**[Page 178, Sec. 1514](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=178)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding the following section.

**[Page 178, Sec. 6056](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=178)** - Employers need to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Resources about the insurance being used by the employees working for them.

**[Page 180, Sec. 1515](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=180)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code, by adding that you can't get a plan using an insurance exchange through a ""cafeteria plan"" (a plan where you specifically pick what is and isn't covered). I think this is saying that if you're well enough off that you're going to nitpick the details of your insurance policy, you can buy all of the elements of that policy directly.

**[Page 181, Sec. 10108](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=181)** - This section has to do with Free Choice Vouchers. Judging from news reports, it looks like it has since been repealed. It would have required employers to provide these vouchers to employees.

**[Page 181, Sec. 139D](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=181)** - More on Free Choice Vouchers. Again, looks like it was killed off after the bill passed.

**[Page 183, Sec. 1551](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=183)** - Says that this part of the bill uses the same definitions as another bill, the Public Health Service Act.

**[Page 183, Sec. 1552](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=183)** - 30 days after this act passed, the Secretary of Health and Human Services had to publish online all of the authorities he has been given under the act.

**[Page 183, Sec. 1553](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=183)** - The Federal Government, States, and insurers cannot discriminate against doctors and hospitals that refuse to do assisted suicide.

**[Page 184, Sec. 1554](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=184)** - The Secretary of Health and Human Services will not promote regulation that limits peoples' ability to get health care, or limits doctors' ability to communicate with patients.

**[Page 184, Sec. 1555](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=184)** - Any Federal Health Insurance Programs created by this act are optional (anything like Medicare and Medicaid, for example). No one has to join them.

**[Page 184, Sec. 1556](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=184)** - Alters another bill, the Black Lung Benefits Act. From what I can tell, this has to do with health problems suffered by coal miners. It looks like it's extending the dates to cover more recent issues.

**[Page 185, Sec. 1557](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=185)** - Health insurance programs benefiting from Federal credits and subsidies cannot discriminate against anyone based on age, gender, race, etc.

**[Page 185, Sec. 1558](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=185)** - Alters another bill, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, by adding the following section.

**[Page 185, Sec. 18C](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=185)** - Employers can't discriminate against employees that have received tax credits.

**[Page 186, Sec. 1559](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=186)** - The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services is in charge of administration and implementation of this law, as it pertains to his department.

**[Page 186, Sec. 1560](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=186)** - Names a few random laws and says ""this bill doesn't change any of these laws"".

**[Page 186, Sec. 1561](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=186)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, by adding the following section.

**[Page 186, Sec. 3021](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=186)** - 180 days after this bill was passed, a couple of Health Information Technology committees will work to start spreading information and helping people enroll in Health and Human Service programs

**[Page 188, Sec. 1562](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=188)** - The Comptroller General of the United States is directed to conduct a study on the denial of coverage. This section details how he's to go about doing it.

**[Page 189, Sec. 1563](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=189)** - It looks like it's basically saying that when you buy a business, you can't use this bill as an excuse to ignore any of the usual laws when doing so.

**[Page 189, Sec. 1563 (Same number, different section) ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=189)** - Alters another bill, the Public Health Service Act, by making many small changes. It looks like most of them are either slight alterations and rewordings, additional definitions of terms, and language that fits in better with this bill.

**[Page 196, Sec. 715](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=196)** - Alters another bill, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, by adding that the rules in that document apply to group insurance plans as well as individual insurance plans.

**[Page 196, Sec. 9815 ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=196)** - Alters another document, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, by adding that the rules in that document apply to group insurance plans as well as individual insurance plans.

**[Page 197, Sec. 1563 (Yet another one with the same number, but a different section) ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=197)** - This basically just says that the Congressional Budget Office says that this bill will reduce the budget deficit, extend Medicare solvency, increase the Social Security Trust Fund, and have savings in a few other areas. It also says that these savings will go towards those programs and not folded back into the PPACA.

That's the only factor I can think of at the moment, -that youth rely more on welfare and support from the state when going to university, moving out of home, buying their first home, etc. Whereas older citizens who are comfortable financially no longer feel the need or see the use for a welfare state.

Obviously it wasn't really there because then i'd choke ... and I didn't, and it didn't last long maybe ten minutes tops.

How have ELI5 links dominated the queue on my front page so dramatically?

EDIT:  I should clarify that my actual subreddit subscription total is 33, but there were exactly 10 ELI5 links listed on my front page within the top 50 posts 6 hours ago.

**EDIT2:  I'm getting some great answers from you guys and think I have pieced together a viable solution to this phenomenon.**  

(1) **The algorithm:** A high upvote/downvote ratio and initial momentum are important in calculating a spot in the queue.  There aren't many downvotes here, and there appears to be pretty high momentum.  But I had only noticed this yesterday, what has happened to cause such a recent dramatic change?

(2) **BestOf:**  Given the recent decision to disallow default subs on /r/bestof suddenly ELI5 is the new /r/AskReddit and suddenly there are now a lot of ELI5 posts that rise to the top of bestof which are then highly upvoted here, causing these posts to subsequently rise up my front page queue.  

I think this is the reason for the outlier results, and I thank [pkmnnerdfighter](http://www.reddit.com/user/pkmnnerdfighter) for being the first to point this out to em.  Also [heyitstval](http://www.reddit.com/user/heyitstval) gets props for being the first person I've ever seen to actually link the mythical algorithm for page ranking... I had forgotten it is all open source code.

**FINAL EDIT:**  This has just turned into ELI5ception, as this very post is now on my front page!  Who wants to submit a comment from here to /r/bestof so it completes the cycle?  

Anyhow, for anybody still reading this, head on over to /r/UpliftingNews for a break from the depressing news.

http://investor.ea.com/stockquote.cfm


In 2005 they had the best stock with around 64 bucks a pop and 2008 they just completely crashed. I know it may be due to the recession but still, in the last four years the trend hasn't been that great. 

I'd think the it would recover eventually but even then, its lowest point was in 2011 when it was going for 11 dollars. Despite making high production value games and getting good reviews and great sales, why is EA still in the gutter? 

Also, please no EA SUX LOL circlejerk here, I'd like a neutral response if possible :) 

EDIT: Holy crap, didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Thanks for the great answers! But it seems so far I've discovered that: 

EA's P/E ratio was unrealistically high (of course, some did think that EA would produce several high quality games, and thus were optimistic) but when it failed to deliver EA's stock plummeted. This combined with a volatile market and  a recent recession AND the failure of SWTOR suggests EA has failed to deliver on the future prospects that the investors hoped they would."

With magnets you have to wait for the file list to load and then dick around with it.

820,explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: When did the tipping culture in America become so hostile?
","When I was a kid, my parents told me, ""If your server does a good job, you leave them a little bit of extra money as a thank you."" More importantly, if the service was bad, you left nothing, because *you were not obligated to leave anything*.

Today it seems like tipping has become mandatory, regardless of the quality of service. Is it because ""times are tough"" or has the expectation shifted for some other reason? I know the minimum wage for servers is lower than the standard, but I also know that if their tips doesn't bring them ""up"" to the standard minimum wage, the restaurant is supposed to kick in the difference.

I ask because we went out to eat last night, and the service was horrible. It took over 30 minutes to get our food (even though the place was dead), the order was wrong, and our server *left* in the middle of our service. Maybe her shift was over, but I'm not sure. We had to ask the manager for our ticket, and when we were asked how the experience was, we, well, *told them it was kinda shitty*, and explained why. The manager listened, then when we were leaving, she asked us if we were going to leave our tip on the table or if we wanted to add it to the bill at the register.

I was *dumbfounded* at this, because in my mind, not only was a tip not warranted, but the server had also, you know, *left*. 

The experience just got me wondering. When did the tipping culture in America change? Or, was it always like this, and I've just come to see it for what it is as I've gotten older?

And when the fuck did 30% become the norm? The manager last night honestly tried to tell me that $5 on a $15 bill was *normal*, but I sure as shit wasn't about to leave that much. I left a buck on the table and left. The whole experience was just bizarre.

Wow. Just wow. It's hard for me to believe how much this place has grown and changed in the last two years. We've gone from an idea in the back of /u/bossgalaga's mind (who was upset about the quality of the available explanations of the hot topic ~~de jure~~ du jour: [the U.S. Debt Ceiling](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/)) all the way to the front page as a [default subreddit.](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/07/new-default-subreddits-omgomgomg.html)

Along the way we [smashed the record for fastest-growing community in reddit history,](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j2m3r/congratulations_li5_you_are_the_fastest_growing/) blazing through to 10,000 subscribers in just under five hours, shattering /r/shutupandtakemymoney's previous record of one week. 

Not content to rest on our collective laurels, we went out and earned ourselves a place in /r/weeklyreddit's list of the [Top 25 New Subreddits of 2011](http://www.reddit.com/r/weeklyreddit/comments/nyhla/top_25_subreddits_of_2011/) in the company of such illustrious companions as /r/DepthHub, /r/LifeProTips, /r/GetMotivated, and the always esteemed /r/NSFW_GIF. And we haven't stopped making the world a simpler place since, one question at a time.

-----

So here we are, a half million-member default subreddit on the front page of the front page of the internet. As you can see from our [recent traffic stats,](http://i.imgur.com/Lj5oCYy.png?1) things are starting to change in a big way around here. Your modteam is working tirelessly to make sure that with all these changes, ELI5 stays true to its roots, taking difficult questions and breaking them down to give simple, layman-friendly answers.

To that end, we recently added 9 new moderators to our team, doubling its size so that we can be sure to have eyes everywhere they're needed in the subreddit to keep posts and responses up to snuff. I'd like to take a moment to recognize them and thank them for all the help they've been already: /u/kouhoutek, /u/Al-Fayyad, /u/SecureThruObscure, /u/corpuscle634, /u/_The_Editor_, /u/LoveOfProfit, /u/saltyjohnson, /u/C47man, and /u/I_Cant_Log_Off.

In addition, we're about to begin an overhaul of all our rules and procedures, including both community rules and internal mod rules (there have been some issues raised recently about mods overstepping their bounds which we want to ensure don't happen again). The mod team is going to work to rewrite the rules to make them clearer to follow and enforce and make them stricter or more lenient **as the community wishes.** 

**Within the next 48 hours, we're going to be making an official post asking for your critiques and suggestions as to how to make this subreddit a better place more in line with its founding vision.**

-----

Once again, thank you all for making this subreddit such a great place to work. Even after two years of moderating, I'm still finding new posts every day that surprise me and explanations that teach me something about the world that I didn't know before.

It's been a wild ride so far; I can't wait to see what the next two years will bring. See you at a million,

Dr_M, for the ELI5 Mod Team

869,explainlikeimfive,ELI5:  Why do all radio stations end in an odd decimal?,"I've noticed all the frequencies in my city end with .1, .3, .5, etc.  I don't know if it's just Vancouver, but can someone please enlighten me as to why?  "
871,explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How does the brain store memories, and how are we able to remember things after having not thought about them for years?","Sometimes something will jog my memory, but it'll cause a lot of other related memories to be released. For example, I was recently near my childhood home and saw an empty lot that was once a miniature golf course. Upon seeing it I vividly remembered going to a birthday party there when I was about 7 or 8. Not only could I remember the party, but I remembered the name of the boy whose birthday it was, what he looked like, the present I brought him, and I remembered a dumb joke I made when I showed up there.

That sort of thing happens from time to time -- something will jog my memory, but I'll be able to remember a lot of other unrelated things. Sometimes when I see a movie, for instance, I'll be able to remember exactly where I was and who I was with the first time I saw the movie. Or other random memories will just pop into my head uninvited.

So my question is this: Where and how are all those memories being stored in my brain? How can I have things that I'd not thought about for possibly decades come back to me with such clarity? Where have they been hiding all this time?

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for all the answers! It makes a lot more sense now, even if the big answer was ""we don't know"". It's amazing being around for this part of history -- we're learning so much so fast. Who knows what we'll know or be able to do in 20 years. (Also I fixed a spelling error)."

877,explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why pictures are square but camere lenses are round?,"Same goes for videos?

--Edit--

I am blown away by the broad array of responses, sadly not all explanations correlate with one another. So I thougt I'd summarize the current explanations:

- The lens is round, but the sensor behind the lens is square.
- Lenses are round and the sensor doesn't absorb all the light(would also infer the sensor to be square)
- Lenses circular, because that way they are the easiest to manufacture.
- Square lenses don't focus light well, and circular film would be harder to make.
- The rectangular format was first chosen because what images used to be made on were sheets of glass coated with a film based post process and these were usually sold 8x10
- It's easiest to make pictures rectangular if you are trying to fit as much film as you can into a roll.
- Because paper is square.

I am seeing a lot of answers which could be true and some which make less sense to me. So, what is the ultimate truth?"

2) If somebody collapsed on the street with no ID and it was a medical emergency, would a hospital treat them? Who would pay if they had no medical insurance? 

3) How much is medical insurance? Can you get different levels for cover like you can with cars? (e.g., ""We'll treat you for everything except cancer"")

4) Is it true that people have thought twice about performing first aid such as CPR on people they don't know just in case they get sued?

EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect this topic to be so big. I suppose I should have been more clear in my original question, the main reason that anime characters appeared white to me was because of their skin color. Now, I'm not trying to insinuate that all people from Asia have to be the color of Filipinos or Indonesians, merely that my perception was one of uncertainty. Thanks to the excellent [video](http://www.youtube.com /watch?v=JKTvFhRbBt8) posted by TurbulentTurtle, I have a much better sense of this.

955,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What/who are gypsies and why does everyone hate them.,"**TL;DR** What/who are gypsies and why does everyone hate them?

Okay, so I just got back from my first trip to Europe. It was lovely, I had a fantastic time, I met up with some other Americans from time to time. There were really only two things that bothered me. One, everything was much more expensive (I was told this was because there's more money in circulation, i.e. people get paid more, but everything costs more, which is why a bottle of coke is 4 Euro's ($4.25 roughly) but back home it's only a dollar.) Not sure if that's legit or not, I would love if someone could break it down with a little more information, but that's not the meat of my issue.

Gypsies. I went over with a group of Americans, we all stayed in the same remote mountain chalet, and one of the first things I was told (by an american living in Berlin) was avoid the gypsies I was told this several times as we were on our way there. Then at a bus stop, a guy tried to pickpocket me. I noticed, tried to grab him, but he ran off, I tried to report it to the police, but they basically shrugged it off saying there's not much that they can do about the gypsies, especially if nothing was taken.

There was also one lady in a market, she was selling some good looking snack food type stuff, so I thought I'd buy some. When she told me the price it seemed high but not totally unreasonable (not that I'm familiar with Euro's or Franks, so I guess I was an easy mark) an older gentleman came up and told me in rather broken English that she was tipping the scales. She started saying something in German, the old guy chuckled and said she was saying some pretty nasty things to him. I ended up not buying anything from her. The old guy told me I would ""be smart to not deal with the gypsies again"".

Finally on the last night/morning, we had to leave the chalet at 3 in the morning to get to the airport on time for our flight. Our bus rolled up on time, and there was a little car that was following it. The car was crammed full of stuff, and there were two people in it. The bus was at the far side of the parking lot trying to arrange itself, and the small car drove right up to our group, while we waited on the porch. The family (I think it's a family) that ran the chalet had checked us out the previous afternoon, and would clean after we left, they weren't awake at the time, counting on us to use the honor system etc. etc.

Anyway, a very pregnant lady gets out of the car and starts talking to us, quickly adapting to English, which she spoke very well, we politely told her, since it wasn't our chalet, we didn't have the right or authority to let her stay the rest of the night here. She said she had begged a ride from a total stranger, and that this was as far as the man would take her (this was basically the middle of nowhere, a very odd place to limit a drive) then she started feeding us some BS, about how she was a Pentecostal minister, begging her way to a mission in Afghanistan. We politely let her know that that didn't change the amount of ownership we had over the property. Then she got upset, started swearing, sometimes switching to other languages, saying she was twice ordained and where she came from you never reject a holy woman. And she was a sergeant in the US military, and if she were still active we would say ""yes sir"" and be happy to have the opportunity to let her stay there. Needless to say it was pretty funny, we all lined up, saluted her and said ""yes sir"" as she got back into the car and angrily drove off. The man driving the little car almost hit our bus driver, who was now walking up to the chalet. Our bus driver told us that they had been following him since he was dispatched, and that the ""damn gypsies"" would frequently follow tourist buses and try to steal suitcases.

Anyway, I've really only had negative experiences with this particular group of people, but I'm thinking it can't really be that bad? I honestly can't tell if someone's a gypsy just by looking at them, so I figure I probably dealt with some honest gypsies and not known. Anyway, there seems to be a lot of hate, and I can sort of see why, given what I've dealt with, but I feel like I probably don't have a complete or proper feel for the situation, if anyone can explain it, that would be very much appreciated.

957,explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: if the human body regenerates every single cell within it every seven years, then why do tattoo's remain throughout our life?","does the pigmentation get copied by new cells?
does it just stain the flesh itself &amp; seep through?
[here is the source for the seven year regeneration information.](http://stemcell.stanford.edu/research/)

/u/thisisntnamman explained quite well &amp; has the most upvotes, here's the answer:

""Your skin has layers. The two big ones are the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the highly cellular one with lots of cell division and shedding. The dermis is blow that layer. It is not nearly as cellular. There is a lot of non-cell connective tissue, fibers and elastics that hold skin together and support all the other little organs in skin. (Latin of the day: epi = above, or above dermis)

A tattoo doesn't put ink in your epidermis. So skin division doesn't effect it. The point of the tattoo needed is to drive the ink below your epidermis into the dermis. Not into any cells but into that fibrous tissue between cells (there's a lot in the dermis). Once there it's stuck. There isn't much cell division or circulation or fluid movement to wash the ink out. So it stays there for a long time. Oh it will degrade, some ink does shed, the dermis breaks down as we get older. So you do loose the vibrant colors and fine shapes.

Henna is an example of ink into the epidermis, it looks pretty but is shed off after only a week."""

357,Showerthoughts,What If WE are an uncontacted civilization?,"(Yes I was inspired from that /r/askreddit thread)

Think about it, there are already uncontacted tribes here on earth (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples), they have no idea  people that are way more advanced in science medicine and techonology are out there, they don't know we exist because they don't have the means to get to us, also right activists groups have adviced for them to be left alone, one of the reasons being they are probably not inmune to our basic dissaeses and also because they have the right to develop as a civilization by their own selves.


What if we are just one big civilization that is being protected like that by more advanced beings? maybe they're also humans, they are way more advanced than us in every aspect and they want to protect us from themselves, they want us to find our own way and don't want to intervene with our society just like what we are doing with the tribes.

Also, what if since we have so many resources here on earth and they are also more advanced in terms of being a more moral and peacefull society they want to keep us away from their bad people that are probably going kill us all and take our stuff if they found out were we are? that's why they keep us in the dark, that's why they don't want us to find them, it's too risky for us.

Maybe I'm getting too crazy here but look at all those pictures taken from the helicopter on wikipedia, look at the tribesmen reactions, just like we react when we see UFOs.. (I mean, we are literally an UFO to them) "
361,Showerthoughts,I used to be attracted to ten year olds,I overcame this shortly after turning eleven.
363,Showerthoughts,Take a moment and let this sink in.,"http://imgur.com/kx7eG

I came across this word and was reminded of a friend who had passed just the other day. We met in an inpatient hospital. I was there because of a suicide attempt and she was there because of her heroin addiction.

I kept thinking of how my mom and dad, friends, teachers, acquaintances, and the like would've reacted had I died the day of my attempt. Then I started making up different scenarios of how people would take the news and continue on with their lives.

Then I thought about my friend and how she probably had these thoughts as well. She would think of her own mother and father, and her friends, and her acquaintances, and everyone else in between. She enjoyed her own set of childhood pleasures and played tag with the person she had a crush on and put bandages on her scraped knees when she fell on the pavement and felt incredible pain and cried for hours at a time for own reasons.

And so did her father. And the people surrounding his life. Everyone that he's ever interacted with had their own lives just as complex and unique as his and hers and my mother's and mine and yours.

Hell, let's go deeper. I even read a showerthought that said that the Queen of England took a shit today. Think about that. Princess Di took shits, Abraham Lincoln took shits. Fuckin' Selena Gomez and her mama took shits. I take shits. You take shits. The people who just fucking rang my door bell looking for my housemate at this goddamned, unreasonable hour took shits. (Fuck them it's 3AM.)

The amalgamated mass of my perception of the collective human consciousness began to unravel and divide and separate into individual specks filled with people's favorite meals and songs that they never got tired of.

We often tend to forget how human we really are. So think about this next time you feel intimidated towards your superior, the girl you've been meaning to ask out, the random stranger you almost awkwardly brushed hands with as you walk beside them in the hallway.

Tonight, I'm going to think about my friend and what she would've thought of this post if I had the chance to show it to her. It's quite beautiful and also insanely mind-numbing knowing that there's this sort of almost paradoxical like connection felt in the uniqueness of every individual's life. There is comfort amongst this ocean of beautiful bodies.

Rest in peace, Michelle."

Slowly humanity will leave the solar system, if not out of curiosity, then out of necessity as the sun will eventually make the solar system uninhabitable. At that point, every Ship or group of ships that part ways will begin the creation of new species. In order to create a new species, one needs a genetically isolated populace, and time. Given the fact that it would be essentially impossible to try to make every single ship stop the genetic isolation it would impose, as humanity drifts through the galaxy, forming new home worlds, eventually it won't be humanity as we know it doing it, but thousands of new species that all have ancestry to a floating rock thousands or millions of light years away.

755,Showerthoughts,"If I ever wrote/directed a TV show, it'd have one character who sometimes just randomly started staring at the camera","Because he *knows* he's only a character in a TV show. It's never explicitly mentioned that he knows, nor does it have anything to do with the plot, but he subtly breaks the 4th wall every once in a while. But it needs to be so subtle that the viewers who aren't specifically looking for the signs won't notice it.

761,Showerthoughts,Adult alcoholics should have a completely voluntary option to have a driver's license that doesn't allow the purchase of alcohol.,"They could opt to have a sideways license, like that of a minor, making it illegal to purchase alcohol.

I'm not saying this would solve alcoholism.  And I'm sure many people wouldn't opt into the program.  And I know that if one really wants alcohol, there's a way.

But I think this could really help a lot of people.  Many alcoholics admit they have a problem, and want to work through it.  They go to AA, get support ect.  But because of the cyclical nature of addictive disorders, they tend to fall of the wagon.

This could provide a voluntary, self imposed roadblock to slow things down and help them when they don't have self control.

Many US states already have vertical licences for minors.  Why not let adults have the option too?"

794,Showerthoughts,How cool would it be to look at extensive and advanced stats about your life after you die?,"Stuff like the percentage of words you used, the percentage of promises kept vs. the ones broken, how many times you lied, how many other times you came close to death without ever knowing it, who you are most compatible with on the entire planet. If you play sports, you could look at your lifetime shooting percentage in basketball, the amount of touchdowns or interceptions you had in football, how many hits you had in baseball; just random shit like that.

If two mind readers were forced to think eachothers thoughts and some one said something, the other would think it. Once he/she thought it, the other would hear their thoughts and think it too. This would go back and forth until something happened.

4,funny,I hate my job...,"My job is so fucking unbelievable. 

I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. 

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit."

Edit: Thanks for all the well wishes.  This has been a hard year losing both my dad and mom to cancer.  The funeral is in a few days and I will be displaying this picture on a collage  - the last one taken of her by anyone.

Reddit is a wonderful place.

Edit2: After many sleepless night s I took a sleeping pill last night only to awake to so much outpouring of love and concern.  Thanks for all the many excellent photoshops.  I know this is something that is worth of money, but I would like to give deep thanks from a devastated family.  I hope to thank you all more personally in the future.

Edit3: My family is so touched.  When I posted I expected a few replies but for over a thousand people to help with the photo, offer condolences, or say how beautiful mom's smile was is overwhelming.  I wish I could take the time to thank each person individually but cannot so I will say it here.  Thank you.  This was a picture from my 40th birthday right before things got bad.  She has so happy.  She was a wonderful mother and a wonderful person.  I have always visited Reddit, but will now consider it home. "

404,food,Yelp is blackmailing my sister's restaurant,"After my sister refused to pay their 'advertising fees' Yelp dropped her rating by filtering most of her 4 and 5 star reviews.  They claim this is the work of their algorithm to filter out biased reviewers, but the filter includes established food critics and otherwise highly-rated Yelp posters.  

Link is to a review their algorithm doesn't filter, a guy who admits he's never even been in the restaurant and gave it 1 star because thats' what the reviews led him to think.  Here is my private response, which explains the situation further: 

Dear Kdu, 

Soak this in for a second, you did the exact same thing to my sister: 

I don't know anything about you, but I think you're a douchebag solely because I read it on the internet

My sister is the owner of Diablo Taco.  As my polar opposite, she is one of the sweetest, most personable people I know.  She has worked in the restaurant and hospitality business since she finished college, and owning a restaurant has been her dream since for as long as I can remember.  

Yelp is not what you think it is.  A week after my sister opened Diablo, a representative from Yelp called her asking for 'advertising money.'  When she replied that her sales were fine and she didn't have the budget to spare because she and her partner self-funded their restaurant, Yelp dropped her rating from 4.5 stars to 3.5.  

4-5 star Reviews from well-established food critics are being blocked, while yours, which openly acknowledges that you've never even set foot in her restaurant much less eaten there, are on the front page.  I don't care what you think about me, but are you proud that you're deliberately hurting my sister, someone you've never met?  

What Yelp is doing is no different than mafia protection schemes - it's basic blackmail because they own the market.  In the end my sister will probably have to pay them to get her ratings back up because hipsters like you care more about Yelp than face to face experience.  

Her name is Summer.  She's wonderful, and everyone there is awesome and dedicated to food.  All I ask is that you go in there and actually try their food.  One taco.  And give them an honest review.  

If you think their prices are too high, that's a fair criticism - her chefs come from high end dining and refuse to compromise the quality of their ingredients, which we both know is the real reason tacos are normally so cheap.  

If you think it's too loud, that's fair too and something they're trying to correct with an interior designer, with money that will otherwise go to pay Yelp's blackmail.  

I used to love Yelp because I believed in its utility, but knowing what I know now I think it hurts restaurant-goers like you and me because it gives an edge to corporate-backed franchises who can afford to pay for higher ratings and hurts the self-made entrepreneur that's trying to get something original off the ground.

This past month has been a rollercoaster for our family.  The restaurant has been well-received by food critics and seems to be doing well with the local population.  On the other hand, she's been in the industry for years and knows that a low Yelp rating can be the kiss of death in a hipster area.   

Last week, my sister called me in tears.  I have no idea how to help her and it kills me.  What Yelp is doing is technically legal because it's written into their EULA and they have no legitimate competitors to expose them.    

In any case, I don't really expect a response and I'm sorry I called you a douchebag.  What would you do?  

Cheers,

Clay

I just want people to know about this.  Please PM me with suggestions on where else I can spread the word.  I believe in the internet."
860,food,To my fellow reddit food lovers: I have come up with a novel idea to help friends get together over dinner more frequently...,"It all started a little over a year ago.  Several of my friends and I all bought houses within our little part of West Philadelphia.  One friend suggested that since we all lived near each other, we could have a certain night of the week where we could take turns cooking and having everyone together to eat.  Our reaction was mixed - though it would be cool to do, our lives are getting busier and it sounds like a big headache.

And then one day I came up with an idea for an all voluntary based system.  We gave my idea a try using google spreadsheets and here's how it worked: anytime a host wanted to make a meal, they'd go to the website and fill in the details (what you're cooking, when, how spicy, and the protein source) and block off the number of seats available for others to use (some houses could hold alot of us, others not so much).  Since you can setup google spreadsheets to notify you by email whenever a certain column or cell changes, that would be the alert mechanism to inform the other households that somebody was making an upcoming dinner.  Anybody in our group could sign up to attend on a first-come first-serve basis.

At the time, we added credits to keep track of who was *mooching* and who was doing their fair share of hosting.  Spouses/sig others would combine their credits (so the ""lessor"" cook of each household had no obligation to cook for the rest of us).

By making it all voluntary, people never had to go to a meal they didn't want to, never had to cook at a time they didn't want to, and never had to be more involved than they wanted to.  Some participated several times a week, others were involved maybe once every other month.

It worked! And it was more successful than I thought it would be.  We were sharing about 50 meals every 3 months between the 8 households.  Through our little system, I began learning how to make Indian curry from scratch, french desserts, and good tex mex all through eating with my friends.  We really saw the value in our little food co-op.

At the time I was manually keeping track of credits on the google spreadsheet.  But I started thinking - what if I made a website that automated every step of the process.  Then this same system could be used by people all over the world.  My way of making the world a cooler place.  I had been looking for a way to improve my PHP/mySQL skills and thought it would be a fun project to tackle.

Well, the [project](http://www.mealshare.org) is finished (just look at my username, but don't downvote me just because my username shills my site, it's like custom license plates - I'm just proud of my little project).

**TL/DR** I made a website that's free to use and creates a voluntary system to help people coordinate getting together over meals.  It worked great for me and my friends, and now I'm giving it to the world.  Check it out.


******

Edit 1: What an amazing day it's been.  So cool to see others check out my hobby for the past many months!  I'll just add one last thing: while it *started* as a way of keeping track of friends eating at friend's houses as described above, I've since added a slew of other tools (and many more planned for the future).  It has got a really good potluck organizer, and there are advanced potluck features that will be released soon.  It also has tools for private dinner parties.  In other words, it'll keep getting cooler in time.

Edit 2: People have been joining so quickly that I'm on the upper end of my website's mail quota at the moment.  I'm working with my host to get that increased but until then if you have any difficulties please be patient.  Lastly, take note of the [blog](http://www.mealshare.org/blog) as I'll detail a whole bunch of upgrades that we'll roll out very soon."

17,Jokes,A rancher dies and leaves everything to his wife.,"She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk.
She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well.
Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night.

One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return.

Two o'clock and no hired hand.

Finally he returned a round two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him.

She quietly called him over to her..

""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said.

Trembling, he did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots.""

He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. ""Now take off my socks.""

He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.

""Now take off my skirt.""

He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light.
""Now take off my bra.."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.

Then she looked at him and said, ""If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired."""

She can't believe he has remembered and starts to tear up.

The husband continues, ""Do you remember 20 years ago when we started dating? I was 18 and you were only 15,"" he said solemnly.

22,Jokes,A young woman in New York...,"... was so depressed that she decided to end her life by throwing herself into the ocean. She went down to the docks and was about to leap into the frigid water when a handsome young sailor saw her tottering on the edge of the pier, crying. He took pity on her and said, ""Look, you have so much to live for. I'm off to Europe in the morning, and if you like, I can stow you away on my ship. I'll take good care of you and bring you food every day."" Moving closer, he slipped his arm around her shoulder and added, ""I'll keep you happy, and you'll keep me happy.""

That night, the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a lifeboat. From then on, every night he brought her three sandwiches and a piece of fruit, and they made passionate love until dawn. Three weeks later, during a routine inspection, she was discovered by the captain.

23,Jokes,So a politician dies...,"And ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.

""So, you're a politician...""
""Well, yes, is that a problem?""
""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!"" 

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician.
""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...

And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini.
""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!""
""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks.
Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...""
Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course.
""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question.
So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...

And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?""
""No sir!"" says the man.
""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"".
""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician.
""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other.
""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Not only are you an honorable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave,"" the Sheikh said with an admiring look on his face. ""If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. And your second wish, what is it to be?"" the Sheikh asked.

In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?""

""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test.""

""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.

""That's right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""

""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""

""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""

""No, on the contrary...""

""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?""

The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""

""No, not really.""

""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""

The man was bewildered and ashamed. This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.

It also explains why Socrates never found out that Diogenes was banging his wife."

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatio thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1 000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero. 

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get Lost. The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the kings underwear. The king immediately summoned Nick."

229,Jokes,The mini skirt.,"In a crowded city at a crowded bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt with matching tight leather boots and jacket.

 As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again she tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. So, with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.

At this the Texan drawled ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.""

276,Jokes,A fly over a stream. [Dirty Joke],"One day, in a peaceful forest, a fly buzzed over a stream.

In the stream, a salmon was swimming, and it looked up and saw the fly. It thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, I'd be able to jump up, catch it, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

Alongside the stream, a bear was standing. The bear looked at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, that salmon would jump up to catch it, and I could jump out, snag that salmon, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

Across the stream, up a steep slope, a hunter was hidden in the brush. The hunter looked at the fly, and thought to himself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, that salmon would jump up to catch it, the bear would jump up to catch the salmon, and I could jump up, shoot the bear, and I'd have myself a new trophy.""

Hidden in the grass behind the hunter was a mouse. The mouse looked at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, the salmon would jump up to catch it, the bear would jump up to catch the salmon, the hunter would jump up to shoot the bear, the sandwich in the hunter's pocket would fall out, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

A bit higher up the slope, on a jutting rock, sat a pussy cat. The pussy cat looked down at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, the salmon would jump up to catch it, the bear would jump up to catch the salmon, the hunter would jump up to shoot the bear, the sandwich in the hunter's pocket would fall out, the mouse would hop over to get the sandwich, I could leap down on it, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

At that moment, the fly dropped down about a half an inch. The salmon leapt up and caught the fly, the bear leapt out and snagged the salmon, the hunter jumped up and shot the bear, the mouse hopped out and started to eat the hunter's sandwich, and the pussy cat leapt down to catch the mouse...but it missed. It rolled down the slope, and fell into the stream.

Moral of the Story: A lot of things have to happen to get a pussy wet.

The devil was very pleased and rang St. Peter to gloat 'thanks for sending me that engineer, he has made hell a really nice place'.

300,Jokes,A tourist in London decides to skip his tour group and explore the city on his own.," He wanders around, seeing the sights, occasionally stopping at a quaint  British pub to soak up the local culture, chat with the locals, and have a few pints of stout.

After a while, he finds himself in a very nice neighborhood with big, stately residences...no pubs, no stores, no restaurants, and worst of all NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS.

He really, really has to go, after all those drinks. He finds a narrow side street, with high walls surrounding the adjacent buildings and decides to use the wall to solve his problem.

As he is unzipping, he is tapped on the shoulder by a London police officer, who says, ""I say, sir, you simply cannot do that here, you know.""

334,Jokes,Reflections on the Jonestown massacre of 1978,"As a society, we sometimes tell jokes about some of the most horrific events--mass murders, disasters, and so on. Often the jokes start within a day or two of the catastrophe, even before the dead can be counted. Perhaps we do it as a coping or healing mechanism, or perhaps it's our only extant type of transmitting oral history in modern times. I'm just not sure. Maybe no one is.

Like you, certainly, I've heard all kinds of jokes about the Holocaust, September 11th, and recent mass shootings. I used to wonder why I never heard a good joke about [Jonestown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown) more than *three decades* after the fact, but then I realized that it was because the punchline was too long."

337,Jokes,Rodney Dangerfield's One Liners,"My wife and I were happy for twenty years. Then we met.

I'll tell ya, my wife and I, we don't think alike. She donates money to the homeless, and I donate money to the topless!

One night I came home. I figured, let my wife come on. I'll play it cool. Let her make the first move. She went to Florida. 

I asked my old man if I could go ice-skating on the lake. He told me, ""Wait til it gets warmer.""

My doctor told me to watch my drinking. Now I drink in front of a mirror. I drink too much. Way too much. My doctor drew blood. He ran a tab.

When I was born the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father, ""I'm very sorry. We did everything we could...but he pulled through.""

I come from a stupid family. During the Civil War my great uncle fought for the west!

My father was stupid. He worked in a bank and they caught him stealing pens.

My mother had morning sickness after I was born.

My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked me as a friend.

My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet.

When I played in the sandbox the cat kept covering me up.

I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a radio.

One year they wanted to make me poster boy... for birth control.

I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent back a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof.

My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting on his lap. He was in the electric chair.

One time I went to a hotel. I asked the bellhop to handle my bag. He felt up my wife!

This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the Fruit of the Loom guys laughing at me.

I'm a bad lover. Once I caught a peeping tom booing me.

My wife only has sex with me for a purpose. Last night she used me to time an egg.

It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass!

My wife isn't very bright. The other day she was at the store, and just as she was heading for our car, someone stole it! I said, ""Did you see the guy that did it?"" She said, ""No, but I got the license plate.""

Last night my wife met me at the front door. She was wearing a sexy negligee. The only trouble was, she was coming home. 

A girl phoned me and said, ""Come on over. There's nobody home."" I went over. Nobody was home!

A hooker once told me she had a headache.

I went to a massage parlor. It was self service.

If it weren't for pick-pocketers, I'd have no sex life at all.

Once when I was lost I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find them?"" He said, ""I don't know kid. There are so many places they can hide.""

I remember I was so depressed I was going to jump out a window on the tenth floor. They sent a priest up to talk to me. He said, ""On your mark...""

When my old man wanted sex, my mother would show him a picture of me.

I had a lot of pimples too. One day I fell asleep in a library. I woke up and a blind man was reading my face.

My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.

Last week my tie caught on fire. Some guy tried to put it out with an ax!

I met the surgeon general. He offered me a cigarette.

I was making love to this girl and she started crying. I said, ""Are you going to hate yourself in the morning?"" She said, ""No, I hate myself now.""

I knew a girl so ugly that she was known as a two-bagger. That's when you put a bag over your head in case the bag over her head breaks.

I knew a girl so ugly, they use her in prisons to cure sex offenders.

I knew a girl so ugly, I took her to the top of the Empire State building and planes started to attack her.

I knew a girl so ugly, the last time I saw a mouth like hers it had a hook on the end of it.

I knew a girl so ugly, she had a face like a saint--a Saint Bernard!

I was tired one night and I went to the bar to have a few drinks. The bartender asked me, ""What'll you have?"" I said, ""Surprise me."" He showed me a naked picture of my wife.

During sex my wife always wants to talk to me. Just the other night she called me from a hotel.

My marriage is on the rocks again. Yeah, my wife just broke up with her boyfriend.

One day as I came home early from work, I saw a guy jogging naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy...why are you doing that for?"" He said, ""Because you came home early.""

I went to see my doctor... Doctor Vidi-boom-ba. Yeah...I told him once, ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in the mirror I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me? He said, ""I don't know, but your eyesight is perfect.""

I told my dentist my teeth are going yellow. He told me to wear a brown necktie.

My psychiatrist told me I'm going crazy. I told him, ""If you don't mind, I'd like a second opinion."" He said, ""All right. You're ugly too!""

I was so ugly, my mother used to feed me with a slingshot!

When I was born the doctor took one look at my face, turned me over and said, ""Look, twins!""

And we were poor too. Why, if I wasn't born a boy, I'd have nothing to play with!

With my wife I don't get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday to 'the best woman a man ever had.' The waiter joined me.

I'm not a sexy guy. I went to a hooker. I dropped my pants. She dropped her price.

I tell you, I'm not a sexy guy. I was the centerfold for Playgirl magazine. The staples covered everything!

What a childhood I had, why, when I took my first step, my old man tripped me!

Last week I told my psychiatrist, ""I keep thinking about suicide."" He told me from now on I have to pay in advance.

I tell ya when I was a kid, all I knew was rejection. My yo-yo, it never came back! 

Oh, when I was a kid in show business I was poor. I used to go to orgies to eat the grapes.

When I was a kid I got no respect. The time I was kidnapped, and the kidnappers sent my parents a note they said, ""We want five thousand dollars or you'll see your kid again.""

I tell ya, my wife was never nice. On our first date, I asked her if I could give her a goodnight kiss on the cheek - she bent over!

I tell you, with my doctor, I don't get no respect. I told him, ""I've swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills."" He told me to have a few drinks and get some rest. 

Some dog I got too. We call him Egypt because he leaves a pyramid in every room.

With my dog I don't get no respect. He keeps barking at the front door. He don't want to go out. He wants me to leave.

What a dog I got. His favorite bone is in my arm!

Last week I saw my psychiatrist. I told him, ""Doc, I keep thinking I'm a dog."" He told me to get off his couch.

I worked in a pet store and people kept asking how big I'd get."

The walls opened up again and a beautiful 24-year-old woman stepped out. 
The father said to his son, ""Go get your Mother."""

341,Jokes,A good bar joke that always makes women laugh,"Jack woke up with a huge hangover after attending his company's Christmas party. He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. 

As bad as he as feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.

Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he saw was couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table.

And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sat up and saw his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. 

He looked around the room and saw that it was in perfect order, spotlessly clean. 

So was the rest of the house. He took the aspirins, and cringed when he saw a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.

Then he noticed a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: 

""Honey, breakfast is on the stove. I left early to get
groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling!""

He stumbled to the kitchen and sure enough, there was hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son was also at the table, eating. 

Jack asked, ""Son, what happened last night?""

""Well, you came home after 3 A.M, drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, 
and got that black eye when you ran into the door.""

Confused, he asked his son, ""So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??

His son replied, ""Oh THAT! Mum dragged you to the bathroom to clean you up, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, 'Leave me alone bitch, I'm married!""

342,Jokes,Why I fired my secretary today.,"
 
Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy birthday!"", and possibly have a present for me.

As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy birthday"".

I thought... well, that's marriage for you, but the kids will remember. My kids ate breakfast and didn't say a word.

So when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary, Jane said, ""Good morning boss, happy birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.

I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know,it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me"".

I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!

""We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day...We don't need to go back to the office, do we?""

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""

She said, ""Let's go to my apartment"".

After arriving at her apartment Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back"".

""OK"", I nervously replied.

She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... followed by my wife, kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"".

And I just sat there...

345,Jokes,A rapist and a con artist get caught...,"A rapist and con artist get caught by the sheriff in a small town.  The town doesn’t have much money to take care of prisoners so the sheriff gets an idea.  He decides he’ll charge money to let the townspeople punish the crooks and use the money to keep them in jail for as long as he can.  The sheriff figures  even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little “justice” from the townspeople.

The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop.  He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin.  Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.

After a while there are two long lines for the criminals.  Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in.  After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore.  I’m not going to waste my money on that.”  So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.

The sheriff sees this and hurries over and says, “Hey son, you can’t do that here.” 

The man asks, “Why not?”

And the sheriff replies, “Because this is the punch line.”"

you the answers to the questions everyone always asks me.... I'm 7
feet tall, I weigh 350 pounds, I have a 20 inch penis, my testicles
weigh 3 pounds each, and my name is Turner Brown.'
The little white Irishman says: 'Turner Brown'?!.... Sweet Jesus, I

407,Jokes,Dead Cow,"On a farm out in the country lived a man and a woman and their three
sons.  Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of
the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow waslying dead in the field.  The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?

In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself.  When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the
hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.

Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the
cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.  When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank.  She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair.  But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and the cow to you."" The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again.  So the mermaid drowned him in the river.

Next the second oldest son woke up.  After discovering what had
happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river.  The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven
times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him
in the river.

The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone.  He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in.  And there he also met the mermaid.  ""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row."" The young son replied, ""Is that all?  Why not twenty times in a row?"" The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request.  Then he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, ""Why not THIRTY times in a row?""

Finally, she said, ""Enough!!  Okay, if you will have sex with me
thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect
health."" Then the young son asked, ""Wait!  How do I know that thirty
times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?"""

to pile up. 

At the end of the line stands Lena surrounded by mountains of Tickle Me Elmo's.

425,Jokes,Three friends die and go to heaven,"*Edited for spelling*

[The names of the friends are interchangeable, try using your own friends' names for added humor]

Three friends die and go to heaven. When they reach the Pearly Gates, St. Peter greets them, giving them the usual speel that everyone gets when they're about to enter, and as they are walking in he says "" By the way, I almost forgot the new rule. Whatever you do, don't step on a duck.""  The three friends think this is an odd rule, but they agree to it and step in. 

The second they enter they realize that the final rule might be harder to follow than they thought. Heaven is TEEMING with ducks!  Try as they might, they quickly realize that avoiding the birds is going to be a difficult task. And then it happens, ""QUACK!""  Friends Two and Three look over in shock as Friend One steps on a duck. Quickly, an angel rushes over with one of the most unattractive people the three of them have ever seen. ""Because you stepped on a duck, you are condemned to spend the rest of you time in the Kingdom shackled to this person. Have a good eternity.""  The angel shackles the two together and flies off. 

After seeing what happened to Friend One, the other two are more wary of the consequences and begin treading extremely lightly. The two of them make it another three days before, on the dawn of the fourth day, a loud ""QUACK"" is heard. Friend Two looks to Friend Three, wide-eyed, fearing the worst. The angel rushes over, ties Friend Two to a hideous being, and flies away. 

The third friend, now petrified that this will be his fate, becomes incredibly paranoid, barely walking anywhere. He lasts one week, two weeks, but on the beginning of the third week an angel brings one of the most stunningly beautiful people the friend has ever seen, shackles the two of them together, and flies off. Bewildered and excited, Friend Three proclaims, ""Wow!  What did I do to deserve this?""  And the person the friend is shackled to turns and replies ""I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck!"""

427,Jokes,why i fired my secretary,"Why I fired my secretary:

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say,
""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""
I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.
My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said,
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!""
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""
I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""
We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.
She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table.
We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.
On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""
I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""
She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""
After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said,
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""
""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.
Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"".
And I just sat there...
On the couch...
Sobbing...

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""

Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ...

Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.

Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""

""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud.

He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.

Then Bud says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""

The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?""

""You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government"", says Bud.

""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?""

""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter. This is a herd of sheep.”

Driver: It's not my car. I stole it.

Driver: That's right.

Officer: There's a gun in the glove box?

Driver: Yes sir. That's where I put it 
after I shot and killed the woman who owns this car and stuffed her in the trunk.


Officer: There's a BODY in the TRUNK?!?!?

Driver: Yes, sir.

called his captain.

It was valid.


Captain: Who's car is this?


Driver: It's mine, officer. Here's the owner' card.


The driver owned the car.

Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box 
so I can see if there's a gun in it?

Driver: Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.


Sure enough, there was nothing in the glove box.

Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? 
I was told you said there's a body in it.

Driver: No problem.

Trunk is opened; no body.


Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you didn't have a license, 
stole the car, had a gun in the glovebox, and that there was a dead body in the trunk.


Driver: Yeah, I'll bet the liar told you I was speeding, too.

He looks around, doesn’t see anything, and quickly shrugs it off. After a little bit, he takes another sip and hears the voice again.

“Oh, those are the peanuts,” he replies. “They’re complimentary.”

put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of
explanation he would make up for his outrageous behaviour.

As I was about to tee off at the fourth hole I heard a voice say, three wood. I looked around and no one was behind me so I took my stance. Then once again I heard ..three wood. I looked down and there was a frog at the corner of the tee box, and he was telling me to use my three
wood. I thought it was stupid but I was playing so badly that I thought nothing could hurt me so I took out my three wood. It was a long par four, and I hit the ball straight 250 yards with that three wood. Since the frog seemed to be lucky I picked him up and took him along with me. At the next hole he told me to use my five iron. It was a par three and I got my first hole in one ever. I made a least a birdie on all the rest of the holes, and all I had to do was listen to that frog.

That night I took the frog to the casino in my hotel. We played Roulette. I put my money where the frog said and won on every spin of the wheel. After that I was tired so I went up to bed. I took the frog out of my pocket and put it on the dresser. Suddenly it looked at me and said, kiss me. Now I wasn't about to kiss a frog, but he said it again. So I kissed the frog and he turned into the most beautiful fourteen year old girl you have ever seen in your entire life.

All was well at first until Maggie took delivery of a 'woman's magazine and began to read things about sex. It soon became clear that she had never climaxed during sex and, according to her Grandmother, all Irish women are entitled to a climax once in a while.

To resolve the problem, Paddy and Maggie went to see the Veterinarian since there was no doctor within thirty miles who could be relied upon not to gossip. However, the Vet didn't have a clue about people. But he did recall during hot summers, his mother and father would fan a cow that was having difficulty breeding with a big towel. 
Apparently, this cooled her down and helped her to relax. So he recommended they hire a strong, young man to wave a big towel over them while they were having sex. This, the Vet said, should cause the young wife to cool down, relax and possibly achieve the sought after climax.

So the couple hired a strong young man from Dublin to wave a huge bath towel over them as the Vet suggested. After many efforts, Maggie still had not climaxed so they went back to the Vet who suggested she change partners and let the young man have a go while Paddy waved the big towel.

They tried it that night and Maggie went into wild, screaming, ear-splitting climaxes, one right after the other for about two and a half hours.

When it was over, Paddy looked down at the exhausted young man and said loudly: ""And dat, me auld son, is how ya wave a feckin' towel!"""

FOR EXAMPLE: One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says “I don’t feel like it, I just want you to hold me.”

I said “WHAT??!! What was that?!”

So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear…
“You’re just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me
to satisfy your physical needs as a man”.
She responded to my puzzled look by saying, “Can’t you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?”

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store.
I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits.
She couldn’t decide which one to take so I told her we’d just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.
Let me tell you…she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck.
I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn’t even know how to play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey”.
She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.
Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, “I think this is all
dear, let’s go to the cashier”.

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No honey, I don’t feel
like it”.

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled
""WHAT?”.

I then said “honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You’re just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.”
And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, “Why can’t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?”.

Apparently I’m not having sex tonight either."

658,Jokes,Use Your Lifeline,"A contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? had reached the final plateau. And as she suspected it would be, the million-dollar question was no pushover. It was, ""Which of the following species of birds does not build its own nest, but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds? Is it A) the condor; B) the buzzard; C) the cuckoo; or D) the vulture?"" 

She did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, and the woman had hoped against hope that she would not have to use it. Mainly because the only friend that she knew would be home happened to be a blonde. 

But the contestant had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: ""That's easy. The answer is 'C' -- the cuckoo.""

The contestant had to make a decision and make it fast. She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving Regis any answer except the one that her friend had given her. And considering that her friend was a blonde, that would seem to be the logical thing to do. 

On the other hand, the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded. 

Time was up. ""I need an answer,"" said Regis. 

Crossing her fingers, the contestant said, ""C) the cuckoo."" 

""Is that your final answer?"" asked Regis. 

""Yes, that is my final answer,"" she said, breaking into a sweat. 

After the usual foot-dragging delay Regis said, ""I regret to inform you that that answer is ... absolutely correct. You are now a millionaire!""

""You're welcome!"" the blonde said. 

""By the way,"" the winner said, not being able to contain the question anymore. ""How did you happen to know the right answer?"" 

""Oh, come on,"" said the blonde. ""Everybody knows that cuckoos don't build nests. They live in clocks."""

As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus.
Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.

Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't.
So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more.
For the second time, attempted the step, and, once again,
and much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg.

a little more and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus.

I don't even know who you are!'


The Texan smiled and drawled,
""Well, ma'am, normally I would
agree with you, but after you unzipped
my fly three times, I kinda
figured we was friends.""

850,Jokes,OLD AGE AND TREACHERY WILL OVERCOME YOUTH AND SKILL EVERY TIME!,"A father, son and grandson went to the country club for their weekly round of golf. Just as they reached the first tee, a beautiful young blond woman carrying her bag of clubs approached them.

She explained that the member who brought her to the club for a round of golf had an emergency that called him away and asked the trio whether she could join them.

Naturally, the guys all agreed.

Smiling, the blonde thanked them and said, 'Look, fellows, I work in a topless bar as a dancer, so nothing shocks me anymore. If any of you want to smoke cigars, have a beer, bet, swear, tell off-color stories or do anything that you normally do when playing a round together, go ahead. But, I enjoy playing golf, consider myself pretty good at it, so don't try to coach me on how to play my shots.'

With that the guys agreed to relax and invited her to drive first.

All eyes were fastened on her shapely behind as she bent to place her ball on the tee. She then took her driver and hit the ball 270 yards down the middle, right in front of the green.

The father's mouth was agape. 'That was beautiful,' he said.

The blonde put her driver away and said, 'I really didn't get into it, and I faded it a little.'

After the three guys hit their drives and their second shots, the blonde took out an eight iron and lofted the ball within five feet of the hole. (She was closest to the pin.)

The son said, 'Damn, lady, you played that perfectly.'

The blonde frowned and said, 'It was a little weak, but even an easy seven would have been too much club. I've left a tricky little putt.' She then tapped in the five-footer for a birdie.

Having the honors, she drove first on the second hole, knocked the heck out of the ball, and it landed nearly 300 yards away smack in the middle of the fairway.

For the rest of the round the statuesque blonde continued to amaze the guys, quietly and methodically shooting for par or less on every hole.

When they arrived at the 18th green, the blond was three under par, and had a very nasty 
12-foot putt on an undulating green for a par.

She turned to the three guys and said, 'I really want to thank you all for not acting like a bunch of chauvinists and telling me what club to use or how to play a shot, but I need this putt for a 69 and I'd really like to break 70 on this course.

If any one of you can tell me how to make par on this hole I'll take him back to my apartment, pour some 35-year-old Single Malt Strath Mill Scotch in him, fix him a steak dinner and then show him a very good time the rest of the night.'

The yuppie son jumped at the thought! He strolled across the green, carefully eyeing the line of the putt and finally said, 'Honey, aim about 6 inches to the right of the hole and hit it firm. It will get over that little hump and break right into the cup.'

The father knelt down and sighted the putt using his putter as a plumb. 'Don't listen to the kid, darlin', you want to hit it softly 10 inches to the right and let it run left down that little hogback, so it falls into the cup.'

The old gray-haired grandfather walked over to the blonde's ball, picked it up and handed it to her and said, 'That's a gimme, sweetheart.' The blonde smiled and said, 'Your car or mine?'"

""Hell no!"" Joe replied. ""Fact is, I'm sort of glad to be rid of her. She was a rotten old thing from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like old, dead fish. She was always holding water. She had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front, too. Every time I used her, her hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy. I guess what finally finished her off was when I rented her to those four guys looking for a good time. I warned them that she wasn't very good and she smelled bad, but they wanted her anyway. Those idiots tried to get in her all at one time and she split right up the middle."" 
The old woman fainted."

Dear Walter,


I hope you can help me here. The other day, I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual. I hadn't driven more than a mile down the road when the engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband's help.

When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbours daughter. I am 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbours daughter is 22. We have been married for ten years. When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted that they had been having an affair for the past 
six months.

I told him to stop or I would leave him. He was sacked from his job six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant. He won't go to counselling and I'm afraid I can't get through to him anymore.

Can you please help?

Sincerely, Sheila

-------------------------------


Dear Sheila:

A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no dirt in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.

I hope this helps.


Walter."

Jones explained the basics of the GI Insurance to the new recruits, and then said: ""If you have GI Insurance and go into battle and are killed, the government has to pay $200,000 to your beneficiaries.


If you don't have GI insurance, and you go into battle and get killed, the government only has to pay a maximum of $6000.""

Nobody raises a hand, so she calls on the first student to look her way. ""Mary, can you tell me which organ of the human body expands to 10 times its usual size when stimulated?""

It was the mailman's last day on the job after 35 years of carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the same neighborhood. When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a big gift envelope. At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.


At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.


""All this was just too wonderful for words,"" he said, ""but what's the dollar for?"" ""Well,"" she said, ""last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you."" He said, ""Screw him, give him a dollar."" The lady then said, ""The breakfast was my idea.""

A lady goes to her parish priest one day and tells him, ""Father, I have a problem. I have two female parrots but they only know how to say one thing.""


""What do they say?"" the priest inquired.


""They say, 'Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?'"" the woman said embarrassingly.


""That's obscene!"" the priest exclaimed, ""I can see why you are embarrassed.""


He thought a minute and then said, ""You know, I may have a solution to this problem. I have two male parrots whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them in the cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrots to praise and worship. I'm sure your parrots will stop saying that...that phrase in no time.""


""Thank you,"" the lady responded, ""this may very well be the solution.""


The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding their rosary beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.


After just a couple of seconds, the female parrots exclaimed out in unison, ""Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?""


There was a stunned silence. Finally, one male parrot looked over at the other male parrot and said, ""Put the beads away, Francis, our prayers have been answered!""

One fine day in Ireland, a guy is out golfing and gets up to the 16th hole. He tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the fairway.


He goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. ""Goodness,"" says the golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy.


Upon awaking, the little guy says, ""Well, you caught me fair and square. I am a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes.""


The man says, ""I can't take anything from you, I""m just glad I didn""t hurt you too badly,"" and walks away.


Watching the golfer depart, the leprechaun thinks, ""Well, he was a nice enough guy, and he did catch me, so I have to do something for him. I'll give him the three things that I would want. I'll give him unlimited money, a great golf game, and a great sex life.""


Well, a year goes past (as they often do in jokes like this) and the same golfer is out golfing on the same course at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits one into the same woods and goes off looking for his ball. When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and asks how he is doing.


The leprechaun says, ""I'm fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?""


The golfer says, ""It's great! I hit under par every time.""


The leprechaun says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is holding out?""


The golfer says, ""Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note.""


The leprechaun smiles and says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your sex life is?""


The golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, ""Well, maybe once or twice a week.""


The leprechaun is floored and stammers, ""Once or twice a week?!""


The golfer, a little embarrassed, looks at him and says, ""Well, that's not too bad for a Catholic priest in a small parish.""

Little Johnny is constantly late for school and what's worse is that he always has a big lie explaining why. The teacher tells the principal that she has had it with his exaggerations. The principal tells her to send Johnny to him the next time he shows up late. He will tell Johnny a lie so big that he will never tell another one. Ever.


The next day, Johnny shows up two hours late. Johnny says, ""I was two hours early today so I had time to fish in the pond on my way to school. I caught a 17-pound trout and had to take it home. If I didn't clean it and freeze it, my mom would've been angry. That's why I'm so late"".


The teacher promptly takes him to the principal's office and explains the story to the principal.


The principal tells Johnny about his own trip to school that day. He says, ""I was walking to school through the park on the trail today when I heard something behind me. I turned around and was shocked to see a giant grizzly bear behind me. He was 24 feet tall and had 6-inch fangs. He was going to eat me, Johnny!

What do you think of that, Johnny?""


Johnny replies, ""Oh yeah, that's my dog Sparky. That's his third bear this week.""

A defendant was on trial for murder in Philadelphia. There was strong evidence indicating guilt, but there was no corpse. In the defense’s closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick.


""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all,"" the lawyer said as he looked at his watch. ""Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom.""
He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened.


Finally the lawyer said, ""Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I, therefore, put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty.""


The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty.


""But how?"" inquired the lawyer. ""You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door.""
Answered the jury foreman: ""Oh, we did look. But your client didn’t.""

First Time

================

The sky was dark

The moon was high

All alone just she and I

Her hair was soft

Her eyes were blue

I knew just what

She wanted to do

Her skin so soft

Her legs so fine

I ran my fingers

Down her spine

I didn't know how

But I tried my best

I started by placing

My hands on her breast

I remember my fear

My fast beating heart

But slowly she spread

Her legs apart

And when I did it

I felt no shame

All at once

The white stuff came

At last it's finished

It's all over now

My first time ever

At milking a cow...

On his first week, the collector picks up over $40,000. He gets greedy, decides to keep the money and stashes it in a safe place. The Mafia soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of their hoods after the deaf and dumb collector.


The hoods find the collector and ask him where the money is. The deaf and dumb collector can't communicate with them, so the Mafia drags the guy to an interpreter.


The Mafia hood says to the interpreter, ""Ask him where da money is.""


The interpreter signs, ""Where's the money?""


The dumb man signs back, ""I don't know what you're talking about.""


The interpreter tells the hood, ""He says he doesn't know what you're talking about.""

The interpreter signs, ""Where is the money?


The deaf man signs back, ""The $40,000 is in a tree stump in Central Park.""


The interpreter says to the hood, ""He says he still doesn't know what you're talking about, and doesn't think you have the balls to pull the trigger.""

met the statistician on a plane. ""How come you changed your
theory?"" he asked. ""Oh, I didn't change my theory; it's just

""Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck.

989,Jokes,Anger Management,"I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I'd forgotten to make. 

I found the number and dialed it. 

A man answered, saying 'Hello.' 

I politely said, 
'This is Chris. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?' 

Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear 
'Get the right f***ing number!' 
And the phone was slammed down on me. 

I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. 

When I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her, 
I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits. 

After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. 

When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled 'You're an asshole!' 
And hung up. 

I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, 
And put it in my desk drawer. 

Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, 
I'd call him up and yell, 'You're an asshole!' 

It always cheered me up. 

When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop. 

So, I called his number and said, 'Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. 
I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?' 

He yelled 'NO!' And slammed down the phone. 

I quickly called him back and said, 'That's because you're an asshole!' 
And hung up. 

One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. 

Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. 

I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. 

I noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number. 

A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole (I had his number on speed dial) 
I thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole, too. 

I said, 'Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?' 

He said, 'Yes, it is.' 

I then asked, 'Can you tell me where I can see it?' 

He said, 'Yes, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd. , in Fairfax 
It's a yellow ranch style house And the car's parked right out in front.' 

I asked, 'What's your name?' 

He said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' 

I asked, 'When's a good time to catch you, Don?' 

He said, 'I'm home every evening after five.' 

I said, 'Listen, Don, can I tell you something?' 

He said, 'Yes?' 

I said, 'Don, you're an asshole!' 

Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too. 

Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. 

Then I came up with an idea... 

I called asshole #1. 

He said, 'Hello' 

I said, 'You're an asshole!' 
(But I didn't hang up.) 

He asked, 'Are you still there?' 

I said, 'Yeah!' 

He screamed, 'Stop calling me' 

I said, 'Make me.' 

He asked, 'Who are you?' 

I said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' 

He said, 'Yeah? Where do you live?' 

I said, 'Asshole, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd., in Fairfax, a yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.' 

He said, 'I'm coming over right now, Don. 
And you had better start saying your prayers.' 

I said, 'Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole,' and hung up. 

Then I called Asshole #2. 

He said, 'Hello?' 

I said, 'Hello, asshole,' 

He yelled, 'If I ever find out who you are...' 

I said, 'You'll what?' 

He exclaimed, 'I'll kick your ass' 

I answered, 'Well, asshole, here's your chance. 
I'm coming over right now.' 

Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, to kill my gay lover. 

Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd in Fairfax .
I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax . 

I got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew. 

NOW I feel much better.

The boss gets about 50 yards from the green and abruptly turns around and drives back to the tee.  The subordinate asks, ""What happened?  Why didn't you say anything to them?""

The boss says, ""I got about 50-60 yards away, and I could tell that the two women were my wife and my mistress.""

Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt. I did this for 2 years at a UC and saved hundreds of dollars.|

Instead, tell her to ""dress for a first date with a guy she really likes"". Now, pick three places you'd like to go: someplace fun and active (bowling, pool, mini golf, go-kart racing, ballgame, etc), something romantic and classy (nice restaurant, upscale lounge, art gallery opening) and something in between (nice bar, coffee shop, comedy club). Now, when you pick her up, let the way she's dressed decide which you’re going to do: If she's wearing something sexy and revealing (dress, high heels, low cut top, etc.) than she wants to go somewhere classy and romantic. If she's sporting some jeans, tennis shoes or flip-flops, and a tee, the bowling ally or pool hall may be a good bet. If she's wearing jeans, high heeled boots, and nice top or blouse, than she's not really jonesing for the super romance treatment, and she put in more effort than mini golf deserves (eighteen holes of mini golf in heels... seriously?), so a comedy club or some place with live music is a good choice. And never, EVER, do a movie on the first date! EDIT: Men: You're going to wear a pair of CLEAN, NEAT jeans, a pressed stylish LONG sleeve button down shirt, nice shoes or boots (try to avoid tennis shoes of sneakers). Works for ANY occasion!|

5,AskReddit,What 'fan theories' have blown your mind with their devastating logic? ,"I like the one about the Rugrats. 

Ever wondered just how Angelica could talk to the babies? Angelica is the only one who can talk to the babies because they are a figment of her imagination. She is spoilt, sad and lonely, because her Mother is constantly working and has no time for her. Her relationship with her Dad is superficial and unsubstantial, no real love is ever shown to her.

So how did it come about that Angelica would have to imagine these babies? Tommy died soon after child birth, a fact reflected by Stu never leaving the basement, inventing toys that his son will never play with. Chuckie died in the car crash along with his Mum, also reflected in the actions of his father; the crash has made him a pathetic nervous wreck most of the time. 

Most interesting is Phil and Lil. There never where any twins, there was just one baby. However this baby was a still born, and Angelica never knew the sex of the still born, so she invented twins of different genders.

Sadly, Angelica never uses her imaginary friends to comfort or entertain her, instead she is mean and nasty to them. She has invented this relationship with these babies so she can vent her frustrations of being a spoilt, lonely brat who has seen much hardship from these unfortunate parents; frustrations that can't be satisfied by a typical childhood relationship with a doll, albeit a Cynthia one.

EDIT: Wow. Went to bed and there was about 25 upvotes. Woke up and now there's quite a lot more, and a [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/) created! Great success!

EDIT II: I have realized how my question could be interpreted the wrong way, hence numerous and humorous links to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death). Indeed, my mind is blown. 

EDIT III: OK I'm heading off now, and by the time I get back this thread will have disappeared into the depths of Askreddit. Thanks for the amazing response!

7,AskReddit,"Reddit, what is the most fucked up way you got back at someone that wronged you. *Throwaways encouraged*","Obviously im going to use one. 

Back in highschool i dated a girl for 6 months before she decided it wasn't working out anymore and she cheated on me with about 6 guys and stole my iPhone and wallet to buy drugs. I wanted to report her to the police like my parents encouraged me to and to prevent me from doing such her brother jumped me while I was walking home with his friends and busted open my lip pretty badly and threatened to kill me if i reported him or his sister (this is South Florida, so i believed he would do it).

My dad got a new job and we moved to a new city but i was still pissed about this whole situation so i did the next best thing. I created two fake facebook account of a random hot girl and guy, spent some time making it look legit with friends and such and added her brother on facebook with the girl and my ex with the guy. 

It wasnt too long before he started flirting ""me"" up and tried his best to get in this girls pants. on the other hand, having already courted my now ex i knew exactly what to say to charm her to the point that she was in love with me. This is where it all begins to get fun.

I started a sexting relationship between the brother and sister with me as the intermediate thanks to google voice. Both of them had fairly typical south florida bodies so nothing really gave anything away and i did a fair amount of photoshopping to remove identifiers in the room that may give away anything. 

This went on for about a month and a half totaling about 200 or so nudes between the two of them when i decided to reveal the curtain and send a group of unedited pictures that included key identifiers (face and rooms). 

Oh holy jesus how shit went down. I only wish i had some way to see how they reacted. Friends who still lived there told me her brother moved in with his dad that week and that they no longer spoke.

All in all, about 4 months till i got my revenge but it was amazing.

EDIT: YOU GODDAMN SONS OF BITCHES. Someone told my Ex about it and now she finally knows forsure that it was me. HAHAHAH. Sucks for her i now live 2000 miles away for college but jesus christ reddit. Dont go shooting your mouth off.

2. Whenever you're sautéing, frying, or wok-ing don't crowd the pan.
3. Prep all of your stuff before starting to cook.
4. Read the whole recipe before you begin cooking.

Awesome steak technique from ironicouch

""My friend's mother taught me how to cook steak a few months back, so far it has not failed me. You have to make sure your steak is dry, use a paper towel to dry it off. Heat the skillet before putting the steak on, you want to hear it sizzle when you place it in the pan. Rub the steak down with just a little olive oil and some sea salt and then place it in the pan for until it starts browning, so it doesn't take long on the stove, then put in the oven at 400 degrees F, for 10 minutes or even less depending on how rare you like it.
Everyone has their own method, but this was the simplest way I have heard it being made, and it always tastes fantastic.""


Another great steak cooking tip from FirstAmendAnon

""Alright, this is a great method, but leaves out a few important details. Here's the skinny on getting you perfect steakhouse quality steaks at home:
Buy a thick cut of meat like a porterhouse. If its more than 2"" thick it's usually better. Look for a lot of marbling (little white lines of fat through the meat). The more the better.
Stick the meat unwrapped on a rack in the fridge overnight (watch out for cross-contamination! make sure your fridge is clean). This ages the meat and helps dry it out. Then like an hour before you cook take it out of the fridge, pat it down with paper towels, and leave it out until your ready to season.
Preheat your oven to really hot, like 500F, and stick your (ovensafe!) pan in there. That will ensure your pan is super hot and get a sear on your meat quickly.
Season both sides of the steak with coarse salt and like a teaspoon of oil. I find peanut oil to be better than olive oil but it doesn't really make much difference.
Pan out of the oven using a thick oven mitt. Stick your steak in there, it should hiss loudly and start to sear immedietly. This is the goodness. 2 minutes on both sides, then stick about three tablespoons of room temperature butter and three sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the steak and throw that baby in the oven.
after about 3 minutes, open the oven (there will be lots of smoke, run your fan), and flip the steak. 2 or three more minutes, pull it out. If you like it more on the well done side, leave it a little longer. Do not leave it for more than like 5 minutes because you might as well just make hamburgers. Take it off the heat. Using a wooden spoon or large soup spoon tilt the pan and repeatedly spoon the butter and juices onto the steak. Baste in all its glory.
Let the meat rest for about five minutes. I use that time to make the plate prettified. Mash potatoes or cheesy grits on the bottom. Brussel sprouts on the side. Maybe some good goats cheese on top of the steak. Be creative.
This method is guaranteed to produce a bomb diggity steak. Like, blowjob-inducing 100% of the time. It's really high-heat and ingredient driven though, so be careful, and spend that extra $5 on the good cut of meat.
EDIT: As a couple of people below have mentioned, a well-seasoned cast iron pan is best for this method.
Also, the 5th bullet is slightly unclear. You take the hot pan out of the oven, place it on the stovetop with the stovetop on full heat, and sear the steak for 2min ish on both sides. Then cut off the stovetop and put the steak in the oven."""
9,AskReddit,Would you support Marijuana legalization if it were taxed and distributed in a way similar to alcohol?,"I think that if it were taxed that it would create more money, also give farmers something else to grow and keep that community going. Not to mention jobs created by having dispensaries, greenhouses, etc. Also it would probably open the door to more research on the plant itself, and potentially see an increase in hemp goods, seeing as how it is a very durable fiber and all, and lets face it most of the goods we have been churning out have been crap lol."

Originally I was planning on traveling through till the end of July but surprise tooth ache had me grounded early (turns out I need my wisdom teeth removed).  I've been home for the last week, catching up on sleep and getting organized for the upcoming school year (which starts next week).

I also [donated the money](http://i.imgur.com/DZhKK.jpg) I raised (via reddit) for filming costs since I managed to stay underbudget all trip (mainly by living off of the hospitality of redditors instead of staying in hostels).

13,AskReddit,Could I destroy the entire Roman Empire during the reign of Augustus if I traveled back in time with a modern U.S. Marine infantry battalion or MEU? ,"So I've been watching HBO's Rome and Generation Kill simultaneously and it's lead me to fantasize about traveling back in time with modern troops and equipment to remove that self-righteous little twat [Octavian (Augustus)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus) from power. 

Let's say we go back in time with a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), since the numbers of members and equipment is listed for our convenience in [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Expeditionary_Unit), could we destroy all 30 of Augustus' legions? 

We'd be up against nearly 330,000 men since each legion was comprised of 11,000 men. These men are typically equipped with limb and torso armor made of metal, and for weaponry they carry swords, spears, bows and other stabbing implements. We'd also encounter siege weapons like catapults and crude incendiary weapons. 

We'd be made up of about 2000 members, of which about half would be participating in ground attack operations. We can use our ~~four Abrams M1A1 tanks, our artillery and~~ mechanized vehicles (60 Humvees, 16 armored vehicles, etc), but we cannot use our attack air support, only our transport aircraft. 

We also have medics with us, modern medical equipment and drugs, and engineers, but we no longer have a magical time-traveling supply line (we did have but the timelords frowned upon it, sadly!) that provides us with all the ammunition, equipment and sustenance we need to survive. We'll have to succeed with the stuff we brought with us.

So, will we be victorious? 

I really hope so because I really dislike Octavian and his horrible family. Getting Atia will be a bonus.

Wow! Thank you for gifting me Reddit Gold! I feel like a little kid who's won something cool, like that time my grandma made me a robot costume out of old cereal boxes and I won a $10 prize that I spent on a Thomas the Tank Engine book! That might seem as if I'm being unappreciative, but watching this topic grow today and seeing people derive enjoyment from all the different ideas and scenarios that have been put forward by different posters has really made my day, and receiving Reddit Gold from Mustard-Tiger is the cherry on the top that has left me feeling just as giddy as that little kid who won a voucher for a bookshop. Again, thank you very much, Mustard-Tiger. I'm sure I will make good use of Reddit Gold. 

Thank you to all the posters who've recommended books, comics and movies about alternative histories and time travel. I greatly appreciate being made aware of the types of stories and ideas that I really enjoy reading or watching. It's always nice to receive recommendations from people who share your interest in the same things.

Edit - In my head the magical resupply system only included sustenance, ammo and replacement equipment like armor. Men and vehicles would not be replaced if they died or were destroyed. I should have made that clear in my OP. Okay, let's remove the magical resupply line, instead replacing it with enough equipment and ammo to last for, say, 6 months. Could we destroy all of the Roman Empire in that space of time before our modern technological advantages ceased to function owing to a lack of supplies?

Edit 3 - Perhaps I've over estimated the capabilities of the Roman forces. If we remove the tanks and artillery will we still win? We now have troops, their weapons, vehicles for mobility (including transport helicopters), medics and modern medicine, and engineers and all the other specialists needed to keep a MEU functional. "

17,AskReddit,How have you made a rude person's day worse?,"Today on the train I sat next to a woman who was angry that I sat next to her because she wanted the two seats to herself. As I sat there she kept mouthing under her breath how she just wanted to sit there alone... blah blah blah. Despite the fact that I wanted to tell her that it was public transportation and she needed to get over it I kept my mouth shut. A few minutes later a large woman with a large purse comes and stands in the same car I was in. I get her attention and tell her that she could have my seat. She huffs and puffs her way to me and I help her sit down while grinning at the angry woman who was upset I'd sat beside her. I enjoyed watching her head almost explode from
anger as the other large woman's rolls and purse pressed against her for the rest of the ride. Anyone else have any of those subtle revenge stories?

18,AskReddit,[UPDATE] My friends call me a scumbag because I automate my work when I was hired to do it manually. Am I?,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tenoq/reddit_my_friends_call_me_a_scumbag_because_i/


Okay, the past month and a half has been insane. Like I said in my last post, the code was originally signed to only run on the desktop that I was assigned, and also required a password upon starting. I felt secure in that they couldn't steal and rip the code and fire everyone. I then went to my manager and told him what I was doing. He asked me (In Dutch...) ""Is the program still on the work desktop, and did you do it on company time?"" I replied yes, and yes. I was promptly fired and expelled from the building. Once I left, I called my bosses superior (? or inferior?? the one higher...) and left him a voice mail saying what happened and that my boss fired me for it, but I thought he was being close minded and not open to advancing the company. I also got a call from my manager, telling me I have to give him the password... I told him I am no longer employed and am not required to any longer.

I get a call from my bosses boss, and he asks to have a meeting with me to discuss what actually happened and if it is true that it could save money, he would listen. but I was hellbent on refusing to give out the password. Not to be mean/defensive, but the code was not designed for anyone to use, it was very primitive in the way it had to be setup. I didn't want to be liable for someone using it incorrectly.

I met with him a week later, we discussed over tea about the program. I asked if I was doing anything wrong or immoral, and he said that the only issue was that I coded it on company time when I wasn't supposed too, and that the app not only was fine (no requirement to have it done by a person), but also saved the money lots and lots of money and they never even realized it. (They would have had to hire more people to handle the load, but didn't because everything was getting done.) 

Once we talked about it, he said I was very talented and asked why I worked in the line of work I do instead of software engineering, I replied that I found this job first and was making such great money-- which he didn't expect, and asked me how much I was making, me telling him the true amount. He was floored and cracked up laughing, I made more than my boss (but not the guy I was talking too). He told me he would love to give me a job doing software engineering for the entire companies systems. I agreed only if that the current employees wouldn't be fired and would be put into different places in the company. We came to a compromise that some of the useless people (There were a few...) would be let go (these people are morons beyond belief), but that he could find jobs for the rest (Translation was a big one, since us Dutch people have a culture of learning others languages, sales, HR and other departments, and a few of them were offered training for the jobs. A handful was kept on the original team but their job was changed from manual input to now they work with the tool I built. As far as I know, the bonus program was slashed a lot, but they're still making more bonus than before I bet since I was taking it all)

So now I am a lead software engineer over my own department, making the same base pay as I was making base+bonus previously. (No bonus, unfortunately haha) Most other workers moved departments or changed jobs in their department, so most people got a good deal.

Except my boss. They were upset with him before this, and were even more upset after him. He was notoriously a bad manager and he was fired over this. Oh well. They hired one of the previous people on my team to take over his job :)

23,AskReddit,"What is the most outlandish (hilarious, surprising) thing you have ever seen go down in public?","As a man that has reached the ripe old age of 48 I can promise you I have seen some shit go down. This one totally takes the cake for me though.

I was waiting out front of a truck stop back in the mid 80's. Sitting on a park bench with a guy that had a big Rottweiler kinda dog on a leash with him. I tried to make small talk but he was quite a sourpuss. So we sat in silence for a few minutes until the most unexpected thing I have ever seen, happened right before my very eyes.

While we were sitting there a big 18 wheeler pulls in without a trailer (bobtail) so he parks right up front like a normal car would. Inside the cab of the truck with the driver is a little monkey. The dance for the organ grinder kind. I think they are called Rhesus monkeys perhaps. Well the dog spots this lil monkey and proceeds to go apeshit over it. Lunging at the end of his leash and barking at the top of his lungs. Generally making a real spectacle of himself to say the least.

The driver is obviously upset, but not nearly as much as the monkey is. Actually upset may be the wrong adjective to use for the monkey though. In retrospect I think eagerly aggressive may be a more appropriate description for his disposition. He was pacing the dashboard back and forth. Never taking his eyes off of this very aggravating dog.

The driver opens his little triangle window that they don't make on cars anymore. The ones made for smokers back in the day. He yells out to this douche bag to call his dog off because it is upsetting his monkey. The guy laughs and says no way (I told you he was a jerk didn't I?). Says that his dog ain't bothering nobody. The dog hasn't shut up since he laid eyes on the monkey. I promise you he is bothering everybody for several blocks around. 

Now here's where things start to get interesting. The driver says that if he doesn't call his dog off he's gonna let his monkey loose on that dog. Douche bag laughs and says that his dog would eat that monkey alive. Upon hearing this the driver leans over and reaches into his glove box I guess. Pulls out one of those tiny baseball bats like you used to get at Astroworld or carnivals, and places it in the monkeys hand.

The monkey obviously knows what's about to go down because he is now trying to squeeze out of that little triangular window I mentioned earlier. This monkey has murder in his eyes if I have ever seen it. Driver hollers ""Last chance to save your dog's ass man."" In response douche bag lets his dog off of the leash. Now we have a situation that has escalated to the point where we have a dog jumping up at the window and a monkey screaming profanities right back at him. Well, the driver finally rolls down the regular window and out leaps all kinds of miniature primate hell. The dog never knew what hit him. Quick as a flash this monkey is riding on the back of this dog's neck. His two back feet all wrapped up in his neck fur with one hand hanging onto an ear. The other hand as you may have guessed by now is steadily and mercilessly raining down blows about this dog's head and face. I mean hard blows. You can hear them whap whap whap.

Well it only took a moment for the dog to realize he was in way over his head. He bolts yelping bloody murder as he runs away at full speed. I mean this dog is running so fuckin hard he's throwing up tufts of grass and dirt as soon as he leaves pavement. The monkey still riding him and beating on him the whole time. Douche bag acts like he wants to fight now but several people including myself stepped in to stop that nonsense. In a couple of minutes or so the little monkey comes loping back with his little bat still in hand, and leaps up into the still open window of the truck to await his master who has gone on into the store.

That wanker ran off to try to go find his dog, but I don't know if he ever did. My ride showed up and I had to go. Never again in this lifetime will I see something so totally crazy and unexpected like that. I am both fortunate and humble to have been so privileged to be present for such an event.

So Reddit, please do tell. What's your craziest thing you have ever seen in public?

25,AskReddit,"I can hear music for the first time ever, what should I listen to?","UPDATE: Wow... Just wow.

14 thousand comments and counting.

I'm humbled and grateful for every one of the comments, upvotes and the endless amounts of music suggestions.

Currently the most upvoted comment isn't a song suggestion but rather a suggestion to listen to the music from the beginnings of its orgins. Here's the original comment below as submitted by GiraffeKiller- ""This is like introducing an Alien to the music of Earth. I wouldn't know where to start. Once you're through your kick on Classical, I might start with music from the 50's and progress through each decade. You can really see the growth of modern music like that.""

I think it's a wonderful idea, and will be blogging about my journey into the world of music. As many of you have pointed out; music didn't start in the 50's, so I'm going to start with the earliest written form of music… I'm going to start with Guillaume de Machaut's Agnus Dei. (Composed sometime between 1313 and 1365)

I am still posting my top 5 next week... It will be a difficult task considering all the submissions.

This week I am going to re-watch my favorite film of all time, Baraka. This will be my first time being able to hear the soundtrack of the film. I will be posting about that as well.

Also for all of those asking- the hearing aids I got is the Phonak Naida S Premium.

Again, thank you for all the kind words and shares!

Even if you’re not hearing music for the first time ever, I suggest looking through the suggestions and expanding your musical tastes. You never know how much more days you have left to hear.... Trust me on this one, you don’t want to miss out on a great song.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

I've never understood it.

My whole life I've seen hearing people make a fool of themselves singing their favorite song or gyrating on the dance floor. I've also seen hearing people moved to tears by a single song. That was the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around. 

I was born profoundly deaf and all music sounded like trash through my hearing aids. 

That is until a couple days ago when I put on a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years. 

The first thing I heard was my shoe scraping across the carpet; it startled me. I have never heard that before and out of ignorance, I assumed it was too quiet for anyone to hear.

I sat in the doctor's office frozen as a cacophony of sounds attacked me. The whir of the computer, the hum of the AC, the clacking of the keyboard, and when my best friend walked in I couldn't believe that he had a slight rasp to his voice. He joked that it was time to cut back on the cigarettes. 

That night, a group of close friends jump-started my musical education by playing Mozart, Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Sigur Ros, Radiohead, Elvis, and several other popular legends of music. 

Being able to hear the music for the first time ever was unreal.

I realized that my old hearing aids were giving me a distorted version of music. they were not capable of distributing higher frequencies with clarity, instead it was just garbled gibberish. 

When Mozart's Lacrimosa came on, I was blown away by the beauty of it. At one point of the song, it sounded like angels singing and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I was able to appreciate music. Tears rolled down my face and I tried to hide it.  But when I looked over I saw that there wasn't a dry eye in the car.

I finally understood the power of music.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Obviously, I did the only sensible thing and went on a binge of music. 

Below are my top 5 favorites from my limited exposure to the world of sound.

1. Mozart's Lacrimsoa
2. The soundtrack to Eleven Eleven… I can see how this comes off as narcissistic, it being my own film and all but it's such a personal work that when I listened to it for the first time I broke down. I felt like I was truly seeing the film for the first time ever. I'm grateful that Cazz was able to capture the tone perfectly. We discussed the film and specific scenes with essay-sized reasoning/deliberations on what should be conveyed. The critical response to the film surprised me and I still didn't quite get it until seeing the visual images coupled with the soundtrack. 
3. Sig Ros's Staralfur 
4. IL Postino-Luis Bacalov 
5. Minnesota's A Bad Place

Ironically enough, I'm turning my hearing aids off more often than before because most sounds are even more annoying and the only times I have it on is when talking to people or listening to music/birds. 

Silence is still my favorite sound. When I turn my aids off my thoughts become more clear and it's absolutely peaceful. 

I hope that one day hearing people get the opportunity to experience utter silence. 

What exactly changed between my old hearing aids and my new ones? 

My previous hearing aids were only 4 years old but technology has gotten cheaper and better at an exponential rate since then. 

Before, I could almost hear the low frequencies at a hearing person’s level, but not as crisp... higher notes on the other hand, I didn’t hear at all. 

I never realized how little of a range my hearing aids picked up compared to hearing people until a telecommunications class in college. We were learning about radio equipment and the guest professor told us about how high human ears can hear and also compared to various animals. 

He turned around and turned the dial down to the lower pitches. I could still hear nearly all the low frequencies  like rest of the class. When he turned the dial in the opposite direction, I blanked out at about 40% and the rest of the class stopped between 90-100%. 

It’s an odd feeling learning something so profound about yourself at twenty one... But it’s not as odd as the things I can hear now.

It was during Lacrimosa that I realized I was truly hearing pitches I’ve never experienced before. It was like seeing a color I’ve never seen before.

I honestly never thought I would really be able to hear my own soundtracks because I have accepted my deafness, I have always been and still am grateful for all I've been blessed with so it was never a big deal to me.

Now... I'm overwhelmed and beyond grateful. 

But this is just the beginning. That’s why I’m asking you to give me the name of the most beautiful songs to you. 

I’ve posted the question on reddit and will listen to the top 30 upvotes and then post my top 5 from that batch.

- Can you in the meanwhile remove that pargraph?

- When is it going to be actually changed?

- Are we going to be allowed to comment on the new user agreement before it is imposed on the community?"
39,AskReddit,What is the saddest lyric you've ever heard?,"Edit: What a response! Thanks for all the comments. The question came about because I've been having songs from Les Miserables stuck in my head the last week, not sure why. I haven't seen the musical or the new movie, only the 10th Anniversary stage version, and I haven't even seen that one in like four years. So whatever. But the lines that have been really getting me are:

But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dream 

And it just got me thinking about how much I love songs that make me sad. Sally Sparrow said this once about being sad: ""It's happy for deep people.""
So now I have a ton of sad songs to look up. 
Thanks everyone!"
40,AskReddit,Hey reddit what's the best HIDDEN thing you have ever found on the interwebz?,"Mine is when I went to the Oatmeal homepage and right clicked and did view page source. (OK SO JUST SAYING MY FRIEND TOLD ME TO DO THIS I TECHNICALLY DIDN'T FIND IT BUT I REALIZED THERE WAS A COMIC) [This came up.] (http://imgur.com/i2CvS) Then I saw that in the words by the PTERODACTYL's mouth it said HTTP://PTERODACTYL.ME so I went there and well [this] (http://theoatmeal.com/comics/ptero) is what it brought me to. I was impressed.

   [EDIT] OK so i wasnt sure if the http address would work so I added the other one they are the same. Just chill about it.

[EDIT] WOW!! I never expected this to become soooo big thank you all! Even getting close to the front page is amazing! Again THANK YOU ALL!! 

[EDIT] Again how did this get so much upvotes. I am surprised. It is the end of my first month of Reddit and I like to think I am doing pretty well.....

[EDIT] Nobody is here anymore but someone just commented about a couple days ago. I thought this was archived. I love cats. Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat. rape. Dead people. Pigeon. I hope someone sees this. And my penis. I have a girlfriend. Gay faggot shit chips. I'm not crazy.. "
42,AskReddit,"Most embarrassing situation you've been in? (Story inside, doubt anyone can top it.)","A few weeks ago I was horny and for god knows what reason, decided to try use my cellphone as a vibrator. 

Anyway... it got stuck up there and the only person who could get me to hospital was my friend (Who thought it was hilarious).

On the way there he posted on Facebook informing the world of my situation, along with my cellphone number.

For the next hour, I sat in the emergency room waiting area receiving uncomfortable stares as the phone in my ass rung and vibrated, All the while my flatmate laughing hysterically and telling me I'd better answer it as it could be important.

If anyone can top this you have my upvote.

EDIT: I am male :(

EDIT2: This story is fake, and It's hilarious you all believe it when I didn't provide a shred of evidence.

44,AskReddit,So at any point in this national tragedy are we going to talk about putting more money into identifying and treating mental illness?,"For those out of the loop:

http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/14/shooting-reported-at-connecticut-elementary-school/?hpt=hp_t1

(Submitted around 3:00 pm 12/14)"
47,AskReddit,Update: In the middle of March I was sitting at a red light and was rear-ended in a hit-and-run where the other car left an imprint of their license on my bumper and reddit figured out the plate number.,"[Link to original](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/r0e88/)

So, amazingly, *crustlessmist* and *jwild98* determined the correct license and created a damning visual aid to show it within hours of my original submission. I gave the information to the police, who took over a week to respond to me, but said that they located the owner of that license and served papers to them.

Meanwhile, I had given the same information to my insurance provider: Geico. They ended up telling me that the other party was also insured with Geico and had submitted a claim just after the accident happened, claiming that they were involved in a hit and run(!). I asked and the agent told me that they claimed the car was parked and unoccupied when it was hit. The other agent got a recorded statement from me over the phone, which was extremely formal. She was all business until she asked if she could stop recording and I said yes, after which she said, ""Woooooow. I haven't had one like this in a long time!""

After some talking and investigation by Geico, they determined that I was the innocent party and I finally got a car rental from them (after a month of sharing a van with my wife and three kids, which is a pain when you need to get to work early). They didn't want to give me the rental earlier because they didn't know whether MY uninsured motorist insurance should pay for it or if we would find the other party and make their insurance pay for it.

Geico found out that the insured person's son had been driving that night and decided to lie about the accident when they got home. I still figure he must have been doing something illegal at the time since he had insurance and still didn't stop. I don't know, though. The police never told me his name and haven't contact me further regarding the issue.

Yesterday, they finally inspected and estimated the repairs my car would need. Today, they told me that they were declaring it a total loss and they will give me $2,800 (and change) for my 2000 Buick LeSabre Ltd. I'm not a car guy, but I remember him saying something along the lines of the ""rails"" being warped and the quarterpanels being bowed out and some other things. They were just looking at body damage and it was over the value of the car (it's not counting the mechanical damage that was done). I have until Friday to determine if I want to accept the offer for the title.

Geico also said they would pay for my medical bills, but it's a one time payment after treatment is ended. I have to give them HIPAA permission to get my bills from my medical providers and they will pay them. They also mentioned something about ""mental anguish"" and ""suffering"" but never mentioned a number. I guess a month without my normal convenient mode of travel and initially not being able to walk without immense pain after the accident count as anguish and suffering... so how much is that worth? I can't really think of an amount that I'd be happy to take if it were going to happen to me again.

So one day I'm sitting at a red light, minding my own business and a month and a half later I've lost my primary vehicle for an amount of money that can't cover a comparable vehicle. 

Still, it was exciting to hunt down the offender and at least get him to be held accountable for his prevarications and douchebaggery. Thank you for all of the help, reddit!

*Edit: saw the wall of text after I submitted and determined I should add a tl;dr*

**TL;DR**: Cops found ass who hit me and ran. Geico also found him. Ass had claimed hit-and-run on his own vehicle. Geico determined I was right and he was wrong. Geico says it will pay for my medical bills. Geico totals my car and offers me $2,800 (I have until Friday to accept). I now have no car.

**Edit:** It is amazingly difficult to keep up with the waves of people crashing into this thread. I just want people to know that I'm doing my best to read the comments, even if I'm not responding to all of them. And I'm totally getting the feeling that I need to speak to a lawyer. :) Thank you.

**Edit:** Wow! The number 1 spot on the front page! And I didn't even misspell anything in the title or make any glaring grammatical errors! To think I was just sitting here tonight browsing reddit and kind of half-assedly thought, ""I guess after today I have enough to give them a decent update... yeah, ok, I'll write it out."" I should have taken a picture of my empty driveway and posted it and then I could have reaped all of this sweet karma. 

**Edit:** I just looked up the guy's name in the court website and found out that he's got a hearing coming up on the 14th. He was charged with ""Failure to Stop / Accident - MISD"" and the code section is [here](http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+46.2-894). It says that it should be a Class 5 Felony. [This page](http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-10) says that a class 5 felony is punishable by a jail term of 1 to 10 years, or up to a year in jail and/or up to $2,500 in fines. The court website lists that as the code section, but it also lists the type of case as a Class 1 Misdemeanor. I should call and tell them my car just got totaled."
48,AskReddit,I'm a political science professor. I gave my students an assignment to write a paper about last night's debate. One of them copied posts on /r/politics and added them to his paper. What's the most entertaining way to let him know I realize what he's done?,"He will be failing the class either way. Unless he can prove he wrote those comments.

EDIT: I see I'm getting a lot of flak for the assignment itself. They could have written the paper while watching the debate, or spent 30 minutes afterward writing it. If they were unable to watch it because of work, school, family, etc issues, I told the students that approached me I'd accept late submissions (within reason) without penalties. That seems fair to me."

We have a breakfast laid on at work every morning, just a simple buffet of eggs, bacon what have you. Nothing huge and it's really only to feed about a dozen people or so. I am usually one of the first guys from my team to get to work and the kitchen was deserted as usual. I walked into the little kitchen, there was a ceramic egg tray thing with 12 eggs in it, like the bottom half of an egg carton with a socket for each egg. All spaces are filled with warm freshly boiled eggs. 

I take one, walk over to the garbage bin, shuck the shell then I walk back over to the food and stop dead. There are 12 eggs in the tray again. ***No one entered the room while I was peeling the thing***. I touched the mystery egg it was the same temp as the other eggs around it.

Not a big thing, nothing major, but something very strange. Given one does not get presented with strange eggs from a parallel universe every day I peeled and ate that one too.

**TL:DR** - Found strange quantum egg at breakfast. Ate it. Did not gain super powers.

***EDIT*** **Holy crap. You magnificent bastards, we're on the front page!** Your stories are wonderful, uplifting and truly freaky in equal measure. But it's nice to know other people notice shit like this too.

82,AskReddit,Ok reddit lets make it...The List of Real Life Cheat Codes!!!!,"got the idea from this: http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/c7osn/so_i_rented_a_movie_out_of_one_of_those_redboxdvd/c0qoplp.

Post your codes and I'll add them to the list!

cheat list:

1. Stop: Stop: Play. Skip advertisements in movies and go strait to the movie.


2. Dial 0 during most automatic menu phone systems to be taken to operator to route your call. also, mashing buttons may work as well. Whenever you have a voice automated phone system, typically saying ""representative"" gets you someone right away. **Update** In regards to Cheat Code # 2 I recommend this site: http://gethuman.com/


3.  keep a spare car key in your wallet/purse. If you have a bulky Key that won't fit in your wallet, get a key made that doesn't have the electronic chip on it. It will still unlock the car, it just won't start it. ***changed by popular request*** **Risk Update:** if your wallet is stolen they have your car key. All they need to do is go to your house some time later and take your car out of your driveway.

4. Riding a bicycle will save you lots of money on gas, parking, medical bills, and gym memberships.


5. If you are speeding and suddenly up ahead see a cop that clearly just tagged you, slow down and wave to him/her. Your odds of being pulled over are quite a bit reduced.


6. Don't be rude, but NEVER answer any cops questions when they call you in for questioning.


7. when getting lectured into voice mail, hit 1, pause momentarily. If you aren't put through immediately, hit *, pause. Finally, hit # if neither 1 or * worked. It is called the 1-star-pound technique, and it works for all cell carriers.


8. If your credit card magnetic stripe starts to get worn from use and being in your wallet, and doesn't always read in the card reader, you can use the plastic bag trick. Put the card in a plastic grocery bag and then swipe it. Not sure why it works, but it does.Taking it further though, you can simply apply a piece of quality cellophane tape over the mag stripe for a ""permanent"" plastic bag trick.


9. At the end of your shower turn the water really (or all the way) cold. This will wake you up and get blood flowing. **Update** update 9: It also closes your pores to allow for less dirt and bacteria to get in to help reduce acne problems.



10. Macy's credit cards usually have a 20% discount on purchases. I pay with the Macy's card, then while still at the register, I immediately pay off the charge with my debit card. I just got 20% off my purchase and I never get a credit card bill. - this also works with JCP and kohl's cards.


11. **im replacing the free movie rental cheat because its unpopular...mostly with movie rental clerks :-/ heres a new one!** When you buy something online, you usually get a chance to enter a promo code before you purchase. Google the promo codes. They're out there - you can get anything from free shipping to 25% off the purchase.


12. Turn it off, then on again.


13. Buy things out of season, this can save you money. Unless its food, then buy it in season.


14. When you have forgotten someones name, simply say : ""I'm sorry, but what was your name one more time."" They may act offended, but when they give you there first name you simply reply ""No, I meant your last name."" (more socially acceptable to forget). Bingo. First and last names.


15. When eating buffalo wings, the flat portions. You can detach the smaller bone on one end very easily, then twist it a bit and it will just slide out. You're now left with a big hunk of meat and only 1 bone, you can just bite it off into your mouth in one piece, flintstones-style. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRcOY-PvOC8


16. Gently work an orange in your hands to loosen the peel from the fruit. This makes it easy enough to get the whole peel in one shot.


17. Can't find your car in a parking lot? hitting the lock button trying to get it to beep? Extend the distance of key-less entry by putting the key under your chin. The signal will resonate in your skull increasing the range dramatically. I swear to god this works, and I'm told it's safe because the radiation is non-ionizing. **verification notice** from ddrt via AskReddit sent 20 hours ago 9 is called the scottish shower. Just sayin' EDIT: I just tried #17 holy shit it works!


18. If you get a ticket on the windshield of your car, you can potentially get away with parking illegally in the same lot for the rest of the day by keeping the ticket on your windshield. **edited** reduced from a few days for a single day.

19. Most tinfoil and saran wrap boxes have little push-in tabs on the sides. If you push them in, the roll won't fall out when you try to rip out a sheet of it.

20. Keep a list of all of the credit card phone numbers (1-800) in your cell phone. This way, if your wallet is ever lost, you can call them immediately to have them disabled. It's also a good idea to place all of the cards in your wallet on a copier and print a page to keep at home. This will give you access to your License #, etc. **Update:** You should update 20. If you lose your wallet.. as in misplace it.. put a hold on your credit cards. Do NOT cancel. If you cancel it can later show up on your credit report. If you believe you are going to find it later, placing a hold saves you the red mark on your report.


21. If you are driving an unfamiliar car and you don't know which side the gas tank is on, just look at the little pump icon next to the gas gauge on the dashboard. The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank. ***Update:*** saw the gas tank one on an older reddit, turns out the handle thing is not consistant. But there IS usually a little arrow next to the icon. **Second Update** 99% of the time the gas door is opposite of the tailpipe. So far, I have only found that early-mid 2000 Pontiac Vibes break this trend. **Third update** if there is no arrow, then it most likely is on the passenger's side. I've yet to see one without an arrow that wasn't on the passenger's side


22. **this tip was unpopular, so im changing it** This one changed my life. If you're at home/work/party or GOD forbid your girlfriend's house and the toilet starts to overflow, take the lid off the back reservoir part and lift the long handle as far up as it will go. The water will stop rising and then you can quietly mutter curses at it till it goes back down (which it does, more often than not...) link to a Diagram: http://superhomeideas.com/images/toilet.gif 


23. to peel a boiled egg, roll it around on your plate for a while until all of the eggshell is cracked evenly. Then it's easy to remove the complete shell at once. After you boil eggs immediately place them in ice cold water for a few minutes. No vinegar or salt or oil or whatever people use. Shells slip right off

24. you spill any liquid that will stain on your carpet (red wine, juice, etc), pour some salt on it. Work it into the carpet - just rub it in with your hands. Leave it there for a few hours (for serious stains, up to a day) and vacuum it out. Voila, stain gone.

25. If you park in a large parking garage/shopping centre, get out and take a photo on your cell phone of the nearest parking sign (Area B2, etc). You will never lose your car again.

26. If you drive stick and the battery s dead, get some friends, put the key to the on position, put the car in 2nd and push the clutch down. have your friends push your car. when you get a decent speed going let the clutch up. (this is called ""Popping the clutch."" your car with start and you can drive around for a while to recharge your battery(provided nothing is wrong with the battery or the alternator). **Update** thanks for the input guys, i switched it from 1st geear to 2nd gear.

27. Tapping on the top of a beer or soda can will make it fizz less!

28. Peel a banana from the bottom, *which is one of /r/sciences 2nd highest scoring link of all time!* http://www.reddit.com/r/science/top/?t=all

29. 4,2,3,1 -- Vending machine cheat code. (As in, the vertical buttons machines, like this one http://www.enterprisevending.com/Images/vending.jpg ). will grant access to vending machine's diagnostic menu. most times the fun features are disabled, but i've gotten a free powerade and a couple cokes in the past.


30. **use this at your own risk *Re: #30, I worked as a parking enforcement officer during college and we can tell when it's fake. The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight).*** College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt. I did this for 2 years at a UC and saved hundreds of dollars.

UPDATE- ok- it must have something to do with firefox. and to all of you telling me how to change lang. preference, OF COURSE I TRIED THAT before i posted. on IE all is normal. on my desktop all is normal. on my netbook, using firefox, it is a taco show. i ran the page through google translator and i especially enjoy the rick roll. so anyone know how to un-spanish reddit in firefox? this is the only page it is happening on.

EDIT- i must admit this is hilarious. i wish i had paid more attention in spanish class....

UPDATE- so I wake up this morning to about 1500 replies in my inbox that I cannot read. And then I run them through Google translator and most of them say stuff like ""the dog is in my pants"" and ""where is the library"". 

Thanks, reddit.  You banded together and helped me to learn how to make a PBJ, and that you are no stranger to love. And also how much you like ""el gato"". 

As far as the Spanish problem goes.. I disabled all my firefox extensions, cleared all my cookies and restarted it all again. THE TACO SHOW IS DEAD! I do not know what possessed my computer to run for the border, but I am glad it is back.

91,AskReddit,"Without even intending to, I just made the greatest pick up attempt of my life so far.  Reddit, what is the smoothest thing you have ever done that resulted in a date?","So I was in a coffee shop this morning studying for a midterm.  At one point I look up from my table and I see a twenty dollar bill laying at the feet of an attractive blonde making an order.  I assumed it was hers since her wallet was open, so I walked over, picked it up and gave it to her. She took a look in her wallet and had all her money accounted for, so she told me it wasn't hers and said something along the lines of 'finders keepers'.  So without thinking I handed the twenty to the cashier to pay for her order and walked back to my table. A few moments later, the blonde walked over to thank me and give me the change.  I said ""I know that normally guys are supposed to introduce themselves first and then take a girl out for coffee, but since I did this all backwards, how would you like to sit down and give me a chance to introduce myself?"" She sat down. We talked. I got her phone number AND a date this weekend.  In no way could I have scripted it any better.

He then waved the box cutter around and swore he wasn't horsing around to which I told him he wasn't getting anything. He said he'd cut me and I told him good luck climbing over the counter to get me. He then placed his hands on the counter and leaned towards me. I grabbed a box cutter of my own and said look at that, a Mexican stand off. Now here is where it gets silly. The man asked if I was threatening him. I said no sir, still laughing at the situation. He then proclaimed he was calling the police and I said please do. He did and he WAITED for the police to arrive! He told them I brandished a box cutter and threatened his life. I then showed the fine officer our security footage and wouldn't you know it? He arrested my new friend. That's my favorite work story, call it bullshit if you want.

106,AskReddit,What's the most shocking thing you've ever caught a family member doing? (possibly nsfw),"This is something I'll never forget. 

I was in seventh grade, and my older sister was in ninth. She was having a bunch of friends from school over. I thought I'd be hilarious, and hide in her closet before they got to her room with the intention of popping out and scaring them. So I'm in the closet just waiting, and my sister comes in the room with about four or five of her friends. They are all just talking for a few minutes, and I start to get bored. I decide it's time to make my move. 

I jump out, and I see something I had never seen in person. Boobs. Boobs everywhere. My sister and all of her friends are standing or sitting around topless and in their panties. I couldn't believe it. They all covered up and yelled at me to get out. 

Don't ever let girls try to tell you they don't do this when they hang out. I've seen it with my own eyes.


EDIT: I don't know what my sister and her friends were into, but it appears no other female on this thread finds my story reasonable. All I know is, I saw boobs.

EDIT: I just realized, the first time I saw boobs in real life was about 6 sets at once, but included my sister. Worth it?"
107,AskReddit,What are some boyfriend/girlfriend/relationship hacks? Example from my girlfriend inside. (Potentially NSFW?),"So last night I was doing some work while my girlfriend was sitting across the room reading. Suddenly -- out of the blue  -- I got turned on. Really turned on. Almost immediately I went over to her and started kissing her, doing things I know get her hot until we spent the rest of the night doing the dirty together. Afterwards, I remarked at how random that was -- I had a lot of work to get done and wasn't really in the mood before. She then informed me that she was horny and just used her ""trick."" 

What was the trick? For the past several months, whenever she did almost *anything* sexual with me, she made sure to put her hair up. Slowly but surely, she built up this connection that whenever she reached back to put up her hair, I would expect something sexy to happen. She had done this so effectively that apparently she could get me horny by just putting her hair up -- no foreplay or anything up to that. I was floored. I immediately remember her doing this to me in public all of the time, and I would never have made the connection if she hadn't fessed up.

**TL;DR: My sneaky bitch of a girlfriend conditioned me to give sex on demand**"
109,AskReddit,What is an item you decided to spend a little bit more on and now you can't possibly go back to an inferior product?,"Here is a compiled list of all the 1000+ upvoted items.  You're welcome :)  I could use some more brand recommendations.

-**TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS**-

**High Speed Internet**: if you live within a FiOS or Cable footprint, get it.  If your only option is dial-up or DSL... I'm sorry

**PC Hard drive - Solid State Drive (SSD)**: It's quiet and with it your PC could boot in just 6 seconds.  Nothing too large is required, when you see a 128G on sale at newegg.com pick it up.  You only really need to put the operating system on it and all your other data can go on a normal hard drive.

**Mechanical Keyboard**: (brands)

**Dual Monitors**: I can speak to this one, I can't function well without looking at two screens.  Have an extra lying around? Use it.  Or buy an extra one you won't regret it.

**Headphones**: Audio TEchnica ATH-M50, these seem to have some great reviews for under $200 bucks.

**Pens**: Pilot G2 Pro, Platinum Preppy Fountain Pen (gouletpens.com)

**Backpacks**: SwissGear (I've had mine for years, use daily still looks new)

**Tools**: Craftsmen, Snap-On

**Real Maple Syrup**: Kirkland Maple syrup

**Parmesan Cheese**: Buy it in a block and grate it yourself.  Avoid the stuff in a can.

111,AskReddit,"My sister went to a 18th birthday party with 3 friends where over 120 people RSVP'd and only the host, his parents and his girlfriend were there. What stories of complete social torture do you have?","She was telling me about it today and i couldn't think about anything except how horrible high school people can be.


So here's the story. This guy set up a facebook event for this party at this big hall and over 120 people RSVP'd. 700+ invited. So it's not like no one knew about it. Considering the amount of people that would know about it and come, even if they hadn't clicked attending, was that high this guy booked a massive hall that could cater for such a large event. This cost him around $1500 which included food, security etc. Then he decided instead of using an iPod, which would probably get lost/stolen on the night, he'd hire a DJ. That cost $400. All of this the host had spent months working his ass off so he was able to actually afford it and hold the 'best party ever!'

Come the night of the party, weeks of preperation money and organisation, this party is expected to go off! My sister heads off to this massive venue, 'fashionably late' aswell, and no one else is there. Much to their surprise, It's just an empty hall with lights going on and a DJ doing his thing. Then she finds the host and asks the normal questions; 'where is everyone' etc. He is as baffled as my sister was. Not even his best mates had shown up which was even more surprising. 

Now this is just the most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing. The host then calls his friends. He asks them 'where the hell are you guys?!' and, obviously on loudspeaker an uproar of laughter comes from the person speaking and you can also hear it in the background. 

He starts crying and everything, absolutely devastated about what has happened. Not only is he out of pocket at $1900 least and knowing that all your friends possibly organised a boycott for this event . When I was told this story i couldn't stomach how harsh and horrible people can be. I never even though this happened, especially on such a large scale as this. 


**TL;DR** *Host works for months to be able to afford expenses for a party which was expected to have over 120 people in attendance. No one actually attended except for my sister, her friends, the host, his parents and girlfriend. When he called his mates to see when they'd come, they, as well as many other people in the background, just laughed at him and hung up*"

Maybe I missed something, but would anyone care to explain why this is happening?

EDIT: To clarify, I couldn't care less what the general opinion of Chris Brown is. The bigger issue at stake, in my opinion, is that a discussion was completely erased on reddit because of views and plans being expressed that opposed the mods' definition of what reddit is for. Do they get to decide now?

EDIT2: My post is no longer visible on r/askreddit. I guess a genuine question regarding reddit as a whole is no longer allowed?

EDIT3: After messaging the mods, they put it back up. I was still not given a reason for it being removed in the first place. 

EDIT4: Finally, a mod gave me a reason why my post was removed (in his exact words, ""askreddit shouldn't be askreddit about reddit"" so...take that as you will), but he's still not coming forward in this thread as to why the Chris Brown Police report has been removed after messaging the mods of r/wtf himself. I'll leave it up to him to give information if he wishes, but I am not giving up his account name. I'm sure many of you can guess who it was anyway.

Last week I setup a survey on a ""free"" survey account.  It was ""free"" until I tried to retrieve the results.  So I promised to make a new one. Here it is.

I've been on reddit for a while, and I really enjoy the community. I always wondered who the people of reddit are. So I make a [quick survey](http://redditsurvey.zxq.net/index.php) to find out.

This is not a scam. Every single question is optional, you don't have to answer a single question if you don't want to. It's 100% anonymous, I don't ask you a single question about your name or account.

You can look through my [reddit profile](http://www.reddit.com/user/JavaLSU/) and see that I've been here for a while, and am not just a bot trying to steal data.

If you have any questions or suggestions let me know. If you think of any new questions I can add them easily.

Now, here's the best part....INSTANT RESULTS!!!!  I've created a [real-time results page.](http://redditsurvey.zxq.net/results.php).  That's updated every time someone takes the survey!

**EDIT:** Please upvote if you take the survey, so that others can see it. Thanks!

**EDIT 2:** I am aware that Atheism and Agnostic are not Religions, but there that was the best place to put them.

**EDIT 3:** Results require flash!

**EDIT 4:** Only two people have reported finding the easter egg.....c'mon guys!

**EDIT 5:** Shutting Down Temporarily for troll cleanup

145,AskReddit,"Reddit, my friends call me a scumbag because I automate my work when I was hired to do it manually. Am I?"," Hired full time, and I make a good living. My work involves a lot of ""data entry"", verification, blah blah. I am a programmer at heart and figured out how to make a script do all my work for me. Between co workers, they have a 90% accuracy rating and 60-100 transactions a day completed. I have 99,6% accuracy and over 1.000 records a day. No one knows I do this because everyone's monthly accuracy and transaction count are tallied at the end of the month, which is how we earn our bonus. The scum part is, I get 85-95% of the entire bonus pool, which is a HUGE some of money. Most people are fine with their bonuses because they don't even know how much they would bonus regularly. I'm guessing they get €100-200 bonus a month. They would get a lot more if I didnt bot.

So reddit, am I a scumbag? I work about 8 hours a week  doing real work, the rest is spent playing games on my phone or reading reddit...

Edit: A lot of people are posting that I'm asking for a pat on the back... Nope, I'm asking for the moral delima if my ~90% bonus share is unethical for me to take...

148,AskReddit,"Reddit, have you ever been part of a significant moment in someone's life and not found out until much later?","When I was in grade 12 English class we had been reading Death of a Salesman.  It was the first class of the day and the Teacher was late.  It was odd, but no biggie, so the class just bullshitted to pass the time.  Five minutes pass, then ten, when I finally spoke up

""Hey, HEY!  We should just keep reading from where we left off yesterday guys.""  I was a very charismatic kid.  Probably the most agreeable guy in school, the friends with everyone type, so everyone actually went along with it.  It's a play, so everyone who had a 'role' the day before just resumed it and we kept reading.


Well, 5-10 minutes later the Vice Principal comes in.  He was obviously surprised that we were doing work, but he didn't mention it.  He just told us our teacher was dealing with a personal issue and she would be a little while longer.


10-20 minutes more passed and she finally showed up.  When she opened the door and saw us there, all reading and paying attention, she burst right into tears of happiness.


She died a couple years later from Cancer, way too young.  She was only 40.  Around the time of her death I found out that was the day she was got her diagnosis/prognosis.  So on one of the worst days of her life, our class helped make it just a little better.

What other weird ""cause-and-effect"" situations have you seen? ","So basically she found that six papers were in some way plagiarized and let the class know that if those people admitted they plagiarized they would lose a letter grade but get to write the paper again. If they didn't respond they would get penalized (aka Fail the course and possibly get expelled from the university). 

She received 19 e-mails back of people confessing, most of which were never even guilty of plagiarism in the first place. 

Funny thing is that only five of the six people who actually cheated responded. One kid never came to class again, and ended up getting severely punished by the university.

What other strange cause and effect situations have you witnessed?

162,AskReddit,Have you ever picked up a hitch-hiker? ,"My friend and I were pulling onto the highway yesterday when suddenly a Mexican looking kid waived us down and ran up to our window. He was carrying a suit case, the big ones like we take on international vacations and it seemed as if he had been walking for a some time. Judging from his appearance I figured he was prob 20-21 years old. He asked us if he could get a ride to ""Grayhun"". We both looked at each other and understood that he was saying Greyhound, and the only Greyhound bus stop in town was at this gas station a few miles down the road. It was cold and windy out and we had some spare time so we told him to jump in. 

Initially thoughts run through your head and you wonder... I wonder whats in that suitcase...is he going to put a knife to my neck from behind the seat... kilos of coke from Mexico because this is South Texas?... a chopped up body?...but as we began to drive I saw the sigh of relief through the rear view mirror and realized this kid is just happy for a ride. When we got to the gas station, my friend walked in and double checked everything to make sure it was the right spot but to our surprise the final bus for Houston left for the day. The next bus at 6:00 p.m. was in a town 25 miles over. We tried explaining this to him, I should have payed more attention in the Spanish I and II they forced us to take in High School. The only words I can really say are si and comprende. My friend and I said fuck it lets drop him off, and turned to him and said "" listen we are going to eat first *making hand gestures showing spoons entering mouth* and we will drop you off after"" but homeboy was still clueless and kept nodding. 

We already ordered Chinese food and began driving in that direction and when we got there, he got out of the car and went to the trunk as if the Chinese Restaurant was the bus stop. We tell him to come in and eat something first, leave the suitcase in the car. He is still clueless. When we go in, our food was already ready. We decided to eat there so he could eat as well. When the hostess came over, she looked spanish so I asked her I was like hey listen we picked this guy up from the street, he missed his bus and the next one is 25 miles over can you tell him that after we are done eating we will drop him off its ok no problems... and she was kinda taken by it and laughed, translated it to the guy, and for the next 10 mins all he kept saying was thank you. After we jumped into the car, I turned to him in the back and was like listen its 25 miles, I'm rolling a spliff, do you smoke? He still had no clue, but when we sparked it up, and passed it his way he smoked it like a champ. He had very broken English, but said he was from Ecuador and he was in America looking for a job to make money for his family back home. Like I said he was prob 20-21 years old. Shorly after, we arrived at our destination, and said farewell. Dropped him off at some store where he would have to sit on a bench outside for the next hour.. but I did my best. I hope he made it to wherever he had to go.

My man got picked up, fed sweet and sour chicken, smoked a spliff and got a ride to a location 30 mins away. I hope he will do the same for someone else one day."
163,AskReddit,"A man once told me if you want a good story just ask any random person if there was ever an event in their life they can not explain. Someone almost always has one weird thing that has happened to them. So reddit, regardless of whatever you belief about the world, do you have a story as such?","I admit I had one when he asked me. Back when I was about 13 or 14 my cousin and I were walking out of a restaurant in central Washington. It was late in the evening and already dark. There was a very large river nearby us and I saw a light in the sky that appeared to follow low above the it. Now there was a small airport across the river so I gave it not another thought to being anything other than a plane. But instead of turning left to the airport it suddenly increased in speed and appeared to shoot upwards and quickly across the town. Then it flew off to the right towards a smaller town about 10 miles away. It then stopped and hovered above it for just a few seconds before a smaller light came up from the ground, appeared to hit the first light, and then both zoomed away in the distance. 

I turned to my cousin and he just looked at me and asked ""did you see that too?""

To this day is it the only thing I have seen in my life I can not explain. What about the rest of you? What is your weirdest unexplained event in life?

**EDIT:** Well I have learned two things from this. The first was that the guy was right about a lot people having one weird story.

169,AskReddit,"Last night I was rammed while stopped at a red light and then the guy took off, leaving me with a LOT of back pain and a significantly damaged car, but nobody to take the blame. Does anyone out there have the skill to decipher the guy's license number from the imprint it made on my bumper?","[Here is an album](http://imgur.com/a/HzYJT#0) of some pictures taken the night it happened and pictures taken this morning in the daylight. The officers tried figuring it out, but none of their guesses brought back any drivers. I live in Virginia, but this happened in a small city that has a university with ~13,000 resident students, so the license could be from any state (or even Canada, I suppose).

I have liability insurance on this vehicle. Geico told me that if they can't cover me that I can at least get coverage through the Virginia Uninsured Motorist fund (or something to that effect). My concern is that my back is very screwed up from this (it was a massive jolt). I've had moderate trouble walking, sitting, and moving today because of the pain. My car also started cutting off while driving to where I suddenly lose power steering, breaking, acceleration, etc while driving. Shifting into neutral and starting the engine fixes it for a while, but I only did that enough to get home. 

**TL;DR**: Got rear-ended while stopped at a red light and the guy drove off. My car is broken and my back is pretzeled and my only hope to find this hit-and-run class act is to decipher the license plate smudge he left on my bumper. Please help!

**EDIT 1**: Remember that the imprint is backwards from what the license actually says.

**EDIT 2**: The Virginia DMV [has an app](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/dmvnet/plate_purchase/select_plate.asp?PLT=&amp;PLTNO=) for trying out different license plate messages, if it helps. It seems to tell you if a license number is available, too.

**Edit 3**: Thank you, to whomever gave me a month of Reddit Gold!

**Edit 4**: Oh, my goodness. I just crawled out of bed and saw that the comment count has risen from 53 to 975! Time to start reading! Thanks, everyone, for looking!

**Edit 5**: crustlessmist [figured out the plate number](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r0e88/last_night_i_was_rammed_while_stopped_at_a_red/c41xem0) and jwild98 made a [convincing graphic showing how that plate number matches up with the impression on my bumper](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r0e88/last_night_i_was_rammed_while_stopped_at_a_red/c41y1tb)! Following that amazing stuff, the following unexciting update: I attempted to leave a voicemail for the officer on my case, but the voicemail system was not letting me in for some reason, so I called non-emergency and talked to an officer there who offered to give the officer a message for me. I'm going to try later today to call again. With this being a smaller city and it being the weekend, I'm thinking I might not have luck until Monday, but I'll keep trying.

**Edit 6**: No updates from anyone yet. I figured I'd go ahead and put the part number from the pieces I found on the ground here. 

One of them says: 

* 52127-06050    ITW    \^UP
* TSOP-1G    &gt;PP+E/P-T15&lt;    R
* TOYOTA

and the other one says

* \^UP    52128-06050
* TSOP-1G   &gt;PP+E/P-T15&lt;
* TOYOTA

The ""ITW"" on the top one looks funny... like it was scratched in by hand. ~~I'm trying to get a picture up, but imgur is having problems.~~ [Here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/F9kS4.jpg)... had trouble focusing with the cellphone.

**Edit 7**: Update: The officer on the case called me and I gave him the information that I've gotten here. He told me that he is actually off this weekend, so he's going to run the tag information on Monday and see if he finds anything. So, I guess I'll have to wait until Monday to learn anything new. I did give the same information to my insurance company, so maybe they'll get back sooner? I don't know.

**Edit 8**: Update: The officer on the case works nights, I believe (I was hit at night), so I don't think he's going to run the plate number until tonight sometime. My insurance company wanted to wait until today to see what the police came up with (although I've let them know about all of the work you guys did, too). I haven't heard anything today. The officer said he would try the plate number and see if anything came back. Obviously, we all know something's going to come back because the report someone ran came back with a VIN number, and I've had some anonymous reports PM'ed to me that point that license back to a town that is only 8 miles away from here, so I'm confident that 5MRTNS is the guy. Now I just need to keep the officers and insurance agents on it. I'll report back once something more significant happens.

**Edit 9**: Didn't hear back from anyone Tuesday. Wanted to give the officer a chance to call me (I believe he works nights) and wanted Geico to get a chance to do their own thing and call me back. I called Geico and the office on my case today around 11am. Left a message with the officer telling him that I'm following up on the lookup he said he was doing, because there's a felon out there and I've been going to the doctor and my car doesn't work, so I'd like to get insurance rolling. I'm going to call again later this afternoon. I think I need to be annoying.

**Edit 10**: I've been calling. Haven't gotten a call back from the police yet, and I can't get the officer on the phone to speak with (only voicemail). Geico let me know that they got the guy's address from the plate number and sent him a letter telling him to contact them. I told them, ""He's the offender in a hit and run. What makes you think he'll call you?"" My case worker is currently trying to get permission to run a report cross referencing their entire database to see if the guy has been involved in other claims and who his insurance provider is. I feel like they're probably doing what they can.

I just left another voicemail for the officer and told him that Geico was able to get the guy's address from their database, so I would assume that he should have been able to as well and to please contact me to let me know what's going on (and gave him 3 different phone numbers he could reach me at). I'm going to keep calling and am considering the current advice of getting the local news involved.

**Edit 11**: I left a voicemail a few days ago with the Investigations Office informing them that I was not getting any calls back from the officer on my case and could someone please let me know what's going on. That night, a Sergeant called me at home and told me he would be leaving messages with the officer and the officer's training officer, letting them know that I need to be contacted. This morning, I finally got a call from the officer, letting me know that they found an address for the plate, but haven't been able to contact the person yet. He said he's hoping to be able to charge the person by this afternoon and that he'll let me know either this evening or tomorrow.

Possibly humorous sidenote: He started his message to me (I was at work and he called my house, yay online voicemail) with: ""I just wanted to shoot you a message..."" the first part of which caught me off guard. :-P

**Edit 12**: The officer called my house again a few minutes ago. He said he served papers to the guy and (according to my wife) said that ""the individual"" seemed like he was just going to plead guilty and get it handled (of course, speaking to a lawyer may change his mind). The officer said that I probably wouldn't be needed in court unless the guy went for a trial, in which case I'd be subpoenaed, but for now my insurance company should have enough to be able to pursue the guy's insurance. All in all it feels rather anti-climactic."
172,AskReddit,"Reddit, would you prefer that deleting a comment simply removes the username and upvote/downvote, but leaves the text?","It seems to happen fairly often that a comment gets deleted and then everyone is left curious as to what it said. It derails context mid-thread. If ""deleting a comment"" simply disassociated the user from the comment, I think that would be perfect. Thoughts?

Edit: Some good arguments against this are in here.

1) Sometimes people delete to remove personal details or because they decide they shared too much, but editing should still allow those details to be removed.

2) People might abuse the system to essentially make bad anonymous comments without having to make a throwaway.

Someone proposed the idea of at least giving the user an option to remove the text or leave it."

176,AskReddit,How long would you let someone pee on you for $300 a day? Details inside,"Hypothetical scenario:

*An anonymous billionaire is privately funding this.  You will never meet them.  They are not filming or recording any aspect of this; they simply enjoy knowing they have this kind of power.*

Each day you are woken up by a man peeing on you.  This man has been hired by the billionaire to pee on you.  They are regularly checked by doctors to make sure they are healthy and infection-free.  Regardless, urine is sterile.  Stinky, but harmless.  

As soon as the pee hits your face (and oh yes, he'll aim for the face) you can jump out of bed and go to the shower.  While you are showering the man who pees on you will switch your mattress, put on new sheets and leave $300 in cash on your dining room table.  

The above situation will happen every single day for the rest of your life until one evening you decide you do not want to be peed on the next morning and cancel.  Then it can never start again.  Ever. 

A few conditions:

-You may have as much or as little interaction with the man who pees as you want

-The man who pees will act as an alarm clock/wake-up call.  You can tell him to begin peeing at 6:30am and that's exactly when he will start.
  
-If you share the bed with someone he will be aiming for you.  Spashback onto the sleeping partner is a possibility.

-If you go on vacation he travels as well.  He will typically stay in the hotel room next to yours.


**The question is:  How long would you let this go on?**


edit:  Apparently R.Kelly likes to pee on people 

edit:  Obligatory ""Holy crap! Frontpage?!"" 

edit:  Now the follow-up question ...  **For $300 a day, would you rather be the man who pees?**  
Same restrictions would apply (but obviously in reverse).  This means that whoever you pee on you are bound to.  If they travel, you travel.  You will have to live in their city (or at least a sensible commute).  You will have to wake up early for your alarm clock function  It will be you to picks up the new mattress the day before and disposes of the soiled one.  Roughly an hour or work a day for $300.  Is this preferable to being peed on given the mobility restrictions?  

edit:  To address a common question:  Barring a once-in-a-lifetime emergency(""My water broke!""), you must be peed on in the morning.  This means if you wake up a few moments before your alarm was to go off you must lay there until the first drop of piss hits you.  You can have a conversation with the man who pees if you like.  Or simply maintain the world's most awkward eye-contact.  

edit:  For any Jack Bauer's out there:  Even if you do not have a regular sleeping schedule you must choose a time in a 24 hour period to lay down in bed and allow pee to hit your face.  "

184,AskReddit,"Dear Reddit: Last night, I finally went on a date with this guy who's been asking me out for the past couple of months. He took me to a weight-loss seminar. What's your ""What the fucking fuck is this"" moment in your dating history?","EDIT: OBLIGATORY WOOOHOOOOOO FRONT PAGE!! Thanks for sharing your stories, and for the kind words as well. I'm not even exaggerating when I say this makes up for my shitty evening with Mr. Revolutionary Lifestyle. So now I just popped open a beer for all of you wonderful people and going through the comments.. I feel almost lucky! Fucking hell, some people are awful!! Hope you've all had better luck since then.. As for myself, I just chalked it up as a lesson.. part of my 'screening' for dating now would include asking the guy if he's into health supplements haha! Really, thanks to all of you.. last night roughly at this time I was moping around after getting home from that 'date'. Now I have countless hilarious stories to read through while drinking and kind messages from you awesome bunch.. worth it!


Story-time (warning: wall of text)

So I've known this guy for almost a year now, not really good friends or anything, more of casual acquaintances (we have a bunch of common friends and see each other from time to time, parties etc). A couple of months ago he started messaging me, first on Facebook, then by text (he got my number from a friend, he didn't ask me for it) and most of the time I responded just to be polite. He's nice enough, but not really my type.. so when he started dropping hints about 'meeting up', I just turned him down and said I'm busy, or we'd just catch up the next time there's a gathering with our friends, that sort of thing..

Fast-forward to last week and he asked me out again, which IIRC is the 6th time in the past 2 months. I finally decided to at least give him a chance, cos hey what could go wrong anyway, and who knows what I'm missing and all that jazz.. Worst-case scenario it would be awkward, but we've talked more than a few times so I was thinking it can't be that bad and we could actually have a pleasant time.

Date night comes and we meet up in the city after work. We have dinner; nice, cutesy Japanese place.. conversation was okay.. I was certain at this point that it's really not going to take off, he really isn't my type.. but I was having a pleasant enough time and he was a total gentleman and not bad to talk to.

The bill comes, and I was going to suggest a quick coffee before heading home. However, he said that there's something he'd made an appointment for us for and we need to rush off to make it in time. I was a bit intrigued and excited; was it a movie, or a show, a play (he knows I'm into theater)? So we hurry off and he took me to a high-end luxury mall with an attached wing for offices.. we went up.. wait, this is an office lobby.. what the..

It was a fucking weight-loss center.

So he explains that he's part of this company (he works for them on a part-time basis as a distributor) and he wanted to introduce me to their products which would 'revolutionize' my lifestyle and make the healthier I've ever been in my entire life. (FYI I'm 5'5"" and 135lbs). I was totally stunned at this point so I was just nodding like an idiot the whole time we were walking inside. He then left me with his smarmy 'teammates', who proceeded to give me an orientation about their company and a run-through of their health supplements (when he got to the part where the weight-loss products are, the smarmiest one said, ""Oooh now this is what you've been waiting for, I saved the best for last!"")

I just sat through it because I knew that if I started to say something, I was definitely going to burst and make a spectacle of myself (there was a seminar ongoing and we were at a little table to the side). After I flat-out said that I'm not interested in any of the products and frankly don't believe that I need health supplements (I eat well and exercise regularly), they started on the 2nd phase: introducing me to the 'business' aspect of it. Basically, it was a networking model of business where you not only sell the products, you also recruit people to sell them and they would be under your 'team', and you get a commission for every sale they make. They rhapsodized about the wonders of the product, how easy it is to sell, and how much money I could be making because they could tell I have the right kind of 'personality' and 'network' for it. Registration was 'only' $1,000, and it was consumable in products.. which I could either use or sell to get my registration money back immediately.

I wish I could say I flipped the fucking table and screamed at them to fuck themselves with their health supplements and hope they overdose on their products, but no.. right after the 'talk' I just said I should head home since it was getting a bit late.

The guy actually messaged me to say that he had a good time and he hopes to see me again.. and that I would reconsider their products and the 'business opportunity'. 

I called some friends up and went out for drinks because fuck your health supplements that's why

TL;DR Went on a date, guy brought me to weight-loss seminar, tried to sell me $1,000 worth of weight-loss products, and then tried to recruit me to join their networking business. "

195,AskReddit,"If the average lifespan of humans were significantly longer (say 3X longer), would our views, philosophies, morals, etc. be different?","This question actually came to me from Mass Effect (can't remember which game in the series, might've been 3).  There some dialogue about how universal policy didn't matter as much to humans because of their significantly shorter lifespans compared to other races (I am probably misquoting, but I believe that was the general sentiment).  This got me thinking about the following questions:

* If the average human lifespan was significantly longer (e.g. 200+ years), would our morals, philosophies, choices be different?

* What kind of effects would it have on our governments, economies, or religions?

I guess two different ways one can approach these questions:

* If humankind had evolved to such a long lifespan thousands to millions of years ago.
* If in the next decade, significant technology allowed for humans to live much longer.

Thoughts?  Comments?

Edit 1:  A good point was made on how the body should age along with the increased lifespan.  For the sake of the post, let's assume it's relative.  So for example, the amount you would age in one year currently would take three years instead.  Of course this is just one viewpoint.  This is definitely an open-ended question and am curious what other Redditor's thoughts are.

220,AskReddit,Update: My sister is now out of the hospital and the best Christmas gift of all? She doesn't hate me. Reddit was right once again.,"I posted [this here originally](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9prfk/so_i_stumbled_across_some_nsfw_pictures_of_my_kid/) and then [this update](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9sw9t/so_my_kid_sister_was_put_in_a_mental_hospital_by/) back in October.

Summary: I innocently stumbled across naked pictures of my little sister on the Internet. From advice I received here on Reddit I confronted her about them. I found out after spying on her that the issue was much larger than it first seemed. She ended being put into a mental hospital because of me and I hated myself for that.

Okay, so my little sister (""Julie"") was in the hospital for almost two months. During that time she refused to see me. My mom, my dad, even two uncles and one aunt? She saw them at visits. But she refused to see me.

I was convinced the entire time that the reason she didn't want to see me was that she hated me. I must have re-read my second post about this a hundred times, just to re-enforce my belief that I had done the right thing by telling our dad about the situation. Believe me, the comments in that second post really did sustain me. I've never loved Reddit so much as I have during some of the worst sleepless nights I've gone through, nights where I felt like the shittiest brother ever. Reading your assurances that I had done the right thing really helped me get along through this very difficult time.

We were told two weeks ago that she was scheduled to be released on the 21st of December. This had nothing to do with money or insurance (my parents were paying out of pocket for her stay there but cost was never an issue). Apparently she has adjusted well to her new medications and is in much better, more sober state of mind now. 

I was thrilled to learn she'd be home for Christmas. I dreaded seeing her only because I have not seen her since the ""intervention"" that led to her being hospitalized in the first place. I was so worried she hated me that I even told my mom, upon hearing the news of her release, that I would gladly crash at my friend's house for a while.

My mom's response? ""Are you crazy? She wants you to be the one to pick her up!""

...

Sorry, I still get teary-eyed when I remember that.

So it turns out that the reason my sister didn't want to see me that entire time (two months!) was that she was embarrassed. She didn't mind seeing our parents or our uncles and aunt but she just couldn't handle seeing me. She felt like she'd let me down or something.

I drove nearly 2.5 hours out to the hospital last Monday (only the second time I'd ever been there), alone, and greeted her in the reception area. She literally ran over and jumped into my arms when she saw me. I cried like a baby, Reddit, and I'm not embarrassed to admit as much.

We talked a ton during the drive home. She has a much firmer grasp on her condition, now, then she did before. Best of all, and Reddit was right about this, she does **not** hate me for ""turning her in"".

She's healthy. She's safe. She's on medications to deal with her Bipolar disorder. And she actually thanked me for intervening before she did something stupid, like meeting up with that one guy (aka ""Asshole"").

I worried so much, for so long, for nothing. My little sister still loves me. And I did do the right thing. Thank you, Reddit, for all of your thoughts and comments during this time. I've been feeling miserable for so long, because of all this, but your thoughtful comments and suggestions helped me from going into despair.

This is why I love this site. Thank you again.

**/edit** A few things. First, to all of you well-wishers, thank you so much for the kind words and good wishes. They mean so much to me you have no idea.

Second, to the anti-meds crowd? Get a job. Sure, meds are sometimes over-prescribed. I won't argue that. But my sister didn't have an ""episode"" or a ""temper tantrum"" that was misdiagnosed as Bipolar Type I Disorder. While I'm sure that happens sometimes, you are in absolutely no position to gauge what my sister was going through. You don't know her, but I do, and trust me the girl who was posting those long, crazy messages on those image boards? The girl who confronted me and threatened me with all kinds of crazy nonsense the day after I talked to her? The girl, in short, who was off her medications? That was **not** my sister. That was my sister in a manic episode. If you have to ask the what the difference is between a manic episode and typical teenage angst/temper, you've never seen one. I hope you never have to, too, because they are scary. Scary scary. 

Sorry, I didn't mean to go on a tirade about that. It's just... frustrating to read some of the holier-than-thou, ""you do realize Bipolar is the ADD of the 2000's, right?"" type of messages this post has garnered. So fucking annoying. Go give L. Ron Hubbard some money but STFU on this post, please.

Again I'm sorry. The vast majority of the responses here have been so supportive and uplifting, but the few trolls who managed to get a bunch of upmods for being contrarian did sort of piss me off.

Done being angry, Reddit. 

Oh, as for her long term care? She's going to be in IOP (Intensive Out Patient) for the foreseeable future. That means, starting in January, daily visits to a local clinic where she'll receive both group and individual therapy. She's also going to see the psychiatrist she took a huge liking to at the hospital once a month until she finds a new doctor to replace her. She's fine with all this, and is actually excited about it. She has this journal she keeps showing me that she writes in when she starts to feel ""unbalanced"". She says it's like her own private ""group therapy"" but she can't wait to be in the real thing again.

Our dad took away her computer but he set it up in the living room, right next to the television set, and she's free to use it whenever she wants. She has absolutely no privacy on it but she seems to be okay with that. 

I think the biggest test will be when she goes back to school. She lost an entire semester because of her hospitalization and she'll be needing to go to summer school to make up for it and while she says she's fine with that, I know it sort of bums her out. Plus, school is usually a ""trigger"" (so I've noticed) for her bad depressive and manic periods. But I really believe she's ready this time. I've never seen her so strong and resolved to handle her condition as she appears right now.

Well, that's it. This is most likely the last ever thing I type using this account. As I mentioned in my original post, I have a real Reddit account that I often use and I simply created this one for this particular issue. I am very glad that I did, too. 

Reddit came through for me in a big way. I hope that others out there who are in any kind of strange/heart-breaking/etc. type of situation look to this experience and find inspiration to share their own story, whatever it is. The trolls and the assholes try to grind us down but Reddit is good at fighting back. I so fucking love this place. I love you all... yes, even the trolls and the assholes.

Adieu, adieu from blind-with-worry.

**edit the last** Okay forgot to mention... as to the Asshole:

Believe me, like most of you, I want to go after this prick. I really do. I actually had a huge argument with my father about this about a month ago. When I calmed down, though, I realized that the legal advice he was getting was correct: fanning flames risks spreading fire. What my sister needs now, what our family needs now, is time to heal. Would it feel good to crush that motherfucker? Sure. Would it draw everything out, though? Definitely. That would not be a good thing. Sometimes what feels good is actually bad or at the very least can make a situation worse than it already is. 

Let me put it like this. Say I posted his Gmail username here. And Reddit went to town crushing him in all sorts of ways. So he decides, ""Heck, that bitch ratted on me. I'll show her!"" and he ends up reposting the obviously self-shot images to every site and image-board, maybe even here on Reddit. Not only would that humiliate her but it might have legal ramifications for her.

What's done is done. Trust me, I know it's a bitter pill to swallow. I'd like nothing better than to meet this asshole someday and do things to him that would get me 20-life in a state prison. But when you think on it logically, what good does that do for my sister? For myself? For my family?

As tempting as it is to send his wife an anonymous letter, too, there's just one problem... I don't have his address. 

In short, I'm just going to have to leave my revenge fantasies to my imagination and Tarantino movies. This asshole/douchebag will likely slit his own throat one of these days anyway. In the meantime, no fanning the flames. Doing so spreads fires.

"
227,AskReddit,"The car ahead of me paid for my coffee this morning, so I decided to return the favor by paying for the person behind me; I was then told that I was 8th person in a row to ""pay it forward."" Any of you experience an unexpected ""pay it forward"" moment like that recently? ","The barista at my local Starbucks didn't tell me until I handed him my card to pay for the car behind me that 8 of us had done the exact same thing. He and the other workers could not stop smiling! All of them seemed really excited about what they just witnessed, and honestly--I was really stunned that 8 of us had ~~independently~~ decided to pay for the car behind us.  

After the madness that was Black Friday, and the horrible behavior that usually accompanies it, I just couldn't help but be amazed at what I had inadvertently been a part of. I've paid for people's meals/groceries/coffee before (especially around the holidays), but I've never been on the receiving end of a ""pay it forward"" chain or somebody that helped keep one going! **I know the 8 of us didn't solve any major world crisis this morning or *really* help anyone out, and the woman behind me may not have actually liked having her drinks purchased by me**--but the semi-anonymous gesture of buying your neighbor's coffee on a cold Sunday morning just...moved me. I just couldn't stop smiling. It was as if kindness was contagious this morning! :D And just thinking about a possible ""pandemic"" of kindness leaves me breathless. 

I'm sure this isn't even the most impressive ""pay it forward"" scenario that people have encountered, so I want to hear your tales! Maybe some of us have all been a part of the same chain of kindness. :) 

**Edit:** So far it looks like drive-thru cafes and tollbooths are common places for this type of masked-goodwill! haha Though I'm really impressed with how u/Drunkdillweed may have started a pay-it-foward chain at a [Little Caesars](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76v4uf).  

**Edit 2:** Alright, coffee is definitely the current leader in the ""thing to anonymously pay for"" category haha. I have included a semi-visual explanation of how this can happen in a drive-thru in a later edit bellow!

**Edit 3.5:** (I've added some **NEW** stories at the end of the list!) While I'm in love with all the coffee stories, here are some hidden gems in case you miss them! [Love flows as much as the liquor in this bar tab story](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76wrz3?context=3); Paying-it-Foward can happen in courthouses too! [A little kindness can lead to some judicial magic](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76wu1x); kindness is extra sweet in this twist on providing random [holiday desserts](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76wyl6); apparently [car washes](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76wxce) are a fantastic place to get a kidness-cycle going; [coupons may be good for redeeming](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76x914) a bit of kindness as well; [depositing some quarters in a meter](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c77117l) may be a great way to drive away some stress in another commuter's day; a toy store worker [saw multi-generational magic](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76xz4d?context=3) when humility was anonymously rewarded; book-lover left a prepaid gift card at a register so that the clerk could reward a family that was supportive of a child reading (link coming); and some non-drama filled [popcorn is gifted (though not accepted) to a couple of movie-goers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c772ydc) I still really love that idea though!; several [""clean cycles"" of kindness](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c771if9) are being spotted in [laundry rooms all over](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c776998); and these folks caught the [ever elusive ""kind-crab"" during their fishing trip](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76xsdr?context=3).

*Most common drive-thru locations for kindness-chains*: Starbucks, Tim Hortons, McDonalds, and Taco Bell. 

**Edit 4:** I just wanted to do a better explanation for how this entire thing occurred, for those of you who've never seen a drive thru cafe. So, in a typical American drive thru you will pull into a driveway that wraps around your favorite cafe/restaurant. Shortly after pulling into the driveway you will roll up to a [giant menu with a microphone](http://blogs.kudl.com/files/2010/03/starbucks-drive-thru.jpg) and this is where we place our orders. Then you pull up to [the window to pay and pick up your beverage/treats](http://pulse995.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/drive-thru.jpg). Once you or any other car pulls away from the giant menu, the barista/window worker has the orders totaled up. So, if you notice [a long line of cars behind you](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JI3v7GDgSTU/TUwNVt1ghDI/AAAAAAAABKU/CopWCapfZZs/s1600/Starbucks_Drive_Thru_012408_fs.jpg) and you'd like to do something nice for the person behind you, you can tell the worker that you'd like to buy the other driver's order too. No guess work is needed about the amount since it's already been totaled. Hope that clears some stuff up!


**Edit 5:** While I'm still planning on updating the above list to help folks navigate around this incredible thread, this will likely be my last ramble. First, thank you for sharing your wonderful stories! I enjoyed reading all of them. :) Second, thank you to the anonymous gifters for the reddit gold!

Now, I know several of you are still critical of this kind of behavior (and I definitely apologize if you've ever been a recipient of one of my errant coffeecup gifts!) and just don't get ""the point"" of all this. I think the biggest concern is that this type of act conflates helping *people in need* with giving a superfluous gift to someone who doesn't need it. I never wanted there to be a weighing of the two types of acts, especially since one is obviously more significant than the other, but I don't believe the latter is totally inconsequential... I mean, one can never be 100% sure that the person standing next to you isn't suffering somehow. That they aren't trying to cope with a terrible loss or struggling through a horrible bought of depression. But still, a coffee cup doesn't do any substantial good for those folks either, but it may just brighten their day a bit, which I think does everyone a bit of good. At the worst, it was a free annoyance. 

What ultimately makes this experience (and others like it) so beautiful for me, and why I think so many others love the concept, is that no one was harmed, nothing was solicited, and the only thing that connected a bunch of strangers for a brief moment in time, was a piece of shared kindness in the form of a cup of coffee. :) These moments are also poignant reminders of just how important it is to give to those who are struggling! If a pre-paid cup of coffee, toll charge, carwash, bar tab, or meal can make such an impact on so many of us, I can't imagine how life changing having someone providing for your actual needs can be. 

Thank you again for these wonderful stories, and I'll still try to add new/hidden ones to my list above. Take care Reddit!

230,AskReddit,Where the hell is a 30 year old supposed to hang out and make new friends?,"Because I have none.  Law school, constant pot use, zoning out on video games and general shittiness have left me utterly friendless.  I had a girlfriend but she split about 2 months ago (the pot use and shittiness being the main causes).  I quit pot but now all I do is school, work, and exercise like a fiend to try and not get high or feel bad that the girlfriend split.  I live in a huge city (LA) but I have a hard time talking to people.  I would love to have people to hang out with because I'm slowly going insane.  Where does one find such a thing when they're no longer so young?"
232,AskReddit,What is something you've tried and wouldn't recommend to anyone?,"As in food, experience, or anything.

Edit: Why would you people even think about some of this stuff? Masturbating with toothpaste?"
233,AskReddit,"reddit, I've answered a lot your questions about being deaf, and I'd like you to return the favor. I have some questions about hearing. (Also, you can AMA about deafness)","I've been deaf since birth and there are lot of ""sound words"" that I read a lot but don't really know what they mean, and dictionary definitions often just refer to other sound words. It's never mattered to me before, but now I'm trying to write a novel with one hearing narrator and every time I use a sound word I'm not sure I'm using it right. I posted awhile ago to /r/writing about ""scream"", ""shout"" and ""yell"" but I've generated a list of questions so I thought I should take it to a larger audience.

* People crying in sadness vs crying out in anger, I know there's some gray area in between where they can be used interchangeably, it's hard to get
* ""shriek"" and ""ream"" are both words that seem to imply emotion more than any specific sound. Is that right?
* Can any sound be described as ""piercing"" if it's loud and annoying? Like thunder for example.
* apparently people use ""ejaculates"" as a dialogue tag?!?! It seems to mean ""to say suddenly or without warning"" (or does it just mean ""interrupt""?), but the more normal use of ""ejaculates"" doesn't imply that at all. I don't know if this is a deaf thing or maybe I'm just dense. Does sound have something to do with this?
* What does ""jive"" mean? Does ""he speaks jive"" and ""he speaks AAVE"" and ""he speaks Ebonics"" all refer to the same thing? I was raised by black parents but I can't understand any dialogue written in black dialect. I know not all black people talk like that but is there a way to mark that in a novel? Do you know of a webpage that would tell me how to translate dialogue into dialect like that? 
* Are ""stammer"" and ""stutter"" synonymous?
* What about ""chat""? Dictionary says ""to speak informally"" but I feel like it implies something I'm not getting. Is it speaking fast? Can you use ""chat"" as a dialogue tag? (like ""What are you doing tonight?' he chatted""), I don't think I've seen it but the dictionary makes it sound like you can.
* ""mumbling"" sometimes implies apathy but other times hostility. Is that right? That's weird because it connotes opposites. What does it sound like? Is it synonymous with whispering?
* I know cats ""meow"", dogs ""bark"" and cows ""moo"" but what does these words mean when used in other contexts? Sometimes other animals are described with the same sounds, like I think foxes bark which makes sense because they're like dogs but I think I've heard dolphins described as barking too. That's weird. Does a dolphin and a dog really make the same sound?
* ""howl"" is just for animals except ""howling in pain"" right? Is a dog's howl just a long bark or does it sound different? Do different dogs sound different? What if they're the same size and breed?
""Chirp"" and ""squawk"" were originally animal noises but are now used in other contexts right? I don't know what they mean really. Birds and mice do them both interchangeably, that's as specific as I know. And I think bats chirp but never squawk? Is there a chart somewhere showing which animals make which sounds? Like, can a weasel growl? What about bears? Bears look like the kind of animal that should ""growl"" but I feel like I've never seen that written and Google doesn't show a lot of usage.
* Do all doors creak? Can all doors be slammed? Windows? Does ""slam"" always imply loudness? Do you always slam doors when you're mad? Do deaf people slam doors when they're mad? (I don't think so, but if it's just a function of being mad I might do it and not notice because I'm mad). People say ""he slammed that beer"" to mean chugged, that's silent right? Or does it mean ""gurgle"" in that sense?
* ""Gurgle"" is another hard one. And ""gargle"", that means something different right?
* ""Ring"", like ""ringtone"" is hard to get. What else ""rings""? Cell phones sound different from landlines, right? People sometimes describe them as ""chirping""?
* Dictionary says ""click"" is ""A short, sharp sound as of a switch being operated or of two hard objects coming quickly into contact."" but I feel like I've seen it in other uses, it's hard to remember exactly what I'm thinking of. But could I use it to describe cymbals, pennies or pencils hitting each other?
* If a voice is described as ""tender"", what does that mean?
* ""moan"" can be painful or sexy right? Anything else? Is it possible to moan joyously or humorously?
* ""cooing"" What is that? Is there a difference between a woman ""moaning sexy"" and ""cooing sexy""?
* Apparently it's possible to ""whisper"" loudly and ""shout"" softly? WTF!?

Thanks for answering any questions you can!

Edit: Thanks, people are answering too quick for me to really read them all, I'm trying to answer questions though.

I ring them up and tell them their total ($40.34 or something like that). The wife says ""Hold on I think I have the change... no never mind I don't."" So I take what they give me, get their change, close the cash drawer, turn to hand their change to them and see she is holding 2 quarters to give to me. She has an angry look on her face and I said ""Oh I'm sorry, you told me you didn't have the change."" The thing that baffles me is that while I was getting her change, she could have spoke up and said ""Hey wait I have it!"" But she chose not to. So in anger she turns to her husband and says ""What does she have? Fucking downs syndrome?"" They both start laughing and I'm standing there shocked that something as terrible as that would come out of someones mouth. And that's when the customer behind them said ""What are you? A fucking bitch?"" The couple storms out and I'm just standing there still in disbelief that someone who is supposed to be an adult would say something like that.

So what are your stories, Reddit? Have at it.


**EDIT:** Holy crap I was not expecting this big of a response. These stories are awesome and disheartening all at the same time.


**EDIT 2:** Thank you to who ever gave me the 3 months reddit gold. Was not expecting that :D

**EDIT 3:** I promised to post some stories from working at McDonalds, so here it goes.

I was working the afternoon shift and this lady comes to register asking for some grilled snack wraps and some other things. I ring her up, get her food to her, and she's on her way. 5 minutes later she comes back storming in claiming I gave her a crispy snack wrap not grilled. So I said to her ""Oh I'm sorry let me get you a new one."" I check the wrap, and it's grilled! She's getting pissed over nothing. I explain to her how I did give her the right one. She insists I didn't so I explain to her how crispy is breaded and the chicken I gave her was not breaded. She get's really loud and start's screaming ""I have my fucking kids waiting in the car, THEY ARE ONLY 3, I don't have time for this bullshit!"" And that's when she throws the snack wrap at me! My manager tells her to get the fuck out as I'm standing there crying covered in snack wrap.

This other story is actually a story about my manager. During the interview at McDonalds, I told them that I would need 2 weeks off in 2 months because I was going to Germany. They said that was okay. So when I was hired, I put the request off in the folder. I also reminded them 2 weeks before I was leaving. So I get back from Germany, and my first day home I get a phone call and it's my manager bitching how she's been trying to contact me for a week because I haven't been showing up. I told her I was away for 2 weeks and that I told her when she first hired me. She started cursing saying how I never told her and how I needed to get my ass to work or I'm fired. I told her ""Go check the fucking request off folder, my paper is in there. Go fuck yourself I'm never coming back."" and I hung up. In retrospect, I could have handled the situation better, but I was jet lagged and cranky from an 8 hour flight.

244,AskReddit,Found a penguin!! Need Help! ,"My kids just found a little penguin on our beach! 

We have called the local environmental agencies, but they will only be here tomorrow.

The poor little thing does not seem to be doing well.

Is there anything we can do until tomorrow?

The kids just named him Gunter  :-)

I am in the extreme south of the state of Bahia in Brazil. It is very rare to find penguins this up north, but this week alone, 3 washed up on the beaches. This is the first one that is alive. 

We are in a very small town, far away from any major cities, so there are no zoos or vets who can help around here. The people we called were not much help (it was the end of the day and the specialists were not in) but we were told that they will come by tomorrow. 

I would just like to know if any biologist here knew if there is anything we can do to help keep him comfortable (and alive) until tomorrow. Anything we can give it to eat? Where would he be most comfortable - in a cool place or not? He is not getting up, but he is moving a lot more now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 2 - Gunter made it through the night!!! He is resting in his towels, and was following me around curiously with his little head when I walked in to check on him. He is sooooooo cute!! We checked him for dehydration and to see if his temperature was ok (as per instruction of a biologist specialized in penguins) and he seemed just fine). He drank and also ate a little. I called the people who will come and pick him up, and the good news is that instead of keeping him the small center until they had more animals for the trip, they will try to drive him off today to the really big center 4 hours north!!  I will take more pics before Gunter goes, and ask the people in the center to keep me updated. Thank you all for the help!!! 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 3 - Gunter does not seem to be doing well at all!! :-(   :-(  He is not responding to when we walk in, and when we touch him, he does not move his head much. He is sleeping and his eyes are closed, but he is breathing heavily. I think he is dying... :-(   :-(   ARGH!! And they called saying they won't be here until the afternoon. It will be too late!! I did not want him to die here  :-( 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 4- Well, maybe he was just sleeping really deeply? Because he woke up and ate TWO live little fish!! He was not interested with the dead stuff yesterday, but he gobbled up the live fish! He also had water!  I am afraid to hope, but how can I help it? Fight Gunter!!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 5- They called again, and should be here soon.

Hopefully under 10k subs, LifeProTips is well known to most redditors, and even then, it's not that useful.

/r/Thesuperbowl is the funniest one yet. I can't believe these guys got to it first."
249,AskReddit,My GF walked in on me making a withdrawal from the spankbank,"Alright, my GF whom I live with, ( A redditor as well if it matters ) walked in on me while i was having a little five on one time and she immediately walked out after seeing me in an awkwardly wrench like position ( You guys know how it is, literally 2 seconds before you're about to clear the snorkel and you dont want to get it on anything in front of you, so you make a little 37.32 degree turn to the left ((or right))) 

Ok so, she walks out..  and like the guy that I am, I finish saying goodbye to the colonel of love, and continue browsing the web like it's no big deal... right ?

I start hearing SOBBING outside the door, I go outside and she goes OFF on me. She goes APE SHIT, ""how could you do that, that's disgusting, thats not normal, you have a fucking gf, why do you do this to me, do you not love me, am I not attractive anymore, do you want me to be some porn slut""? 

She then left the apartment, and I have not heard from her yet ( it's been 7 hours ). **I love my gf dearly**, but i'm not sure what just happened.... Is it really that big of a deal ? Like, am I a douche for wanting some self diddling time ?  WTF DO I DO REDDIT, I'm afraid when she comes back I wont be able to say anything to say, should I apologize ? Say it'll never happen again ? 

**HELP ME REDDIT**

**EDIT** Please don't make this a front page post, my gf is a redditor too. I just wanted some quick answers.

**EDIT2** She called me, was sobbing a little. I told her we ""need to talk"" She said ""ya"" and said she'll be home in a couple of hours, shes with her mom ( IS SHE GOING TO TELL HER ? )

**EDIT 3** I just received a text from her ""my mom is coming over with me, clean up a little.."" I'm leaving going to a friends house, I do NOT want to deal with that if she told her. ( I smoked a little to calm down, and I don't think I'm ready for a parental confrontation )

**EDIT 4** I'm at my friends house now, and you guys made this front page... wow FU. Ok to clear some things up though between us, We have an AMAZING relationship, we NEVER argue, we have fun together just her and I. I love this girl to death, I hate seeing her unhappy. To clarify ""our sex life is amazing""; Whenever she's in the mood, I'm down. And yes there are times when I'm in the mood and she's not that I give her the space needed. This is normal though ? Guys do generally want it more then women ? It doesn't bother me, and we've been together for about a year and a half, and I have Waxed the Winnebago before but she has NEVER caught me. This is actually the first time I've ever been caught.

And Ashley, since I know you'll read this: ILY, I know you'll hate me for doing this, but please read some of these comments. I'm sorry that you felt it inappropriate and im sorry for not talking to you about it, ever. I think you're the most amazing girl in the world.. and again, i'm sorry.


**EDIT 5** She read this, the stupidest shit gets to the front knews, so now I have to go over there. Today /r/gonewild/ gets me in trouble, then reddit finishes me with a front page fatality.

**EDIT 6** Guys, the whole ""FU , reddit getting me in trouble, stuff is not serious. I just say stuff like that to lighten the topic, I'm saying it sarcastically. I love reddit, and agree with most of you.

*I understand she's overreacting, which is why I am going to talk to her, but you guys need to understand as well that it's someone I care about. Someone I care about felt hurt due to something I did. Sure it might have been an overreaction, nonetheless someone I care about felt hurt. Also, I'm not apologizing for making the cyclops fight a 5 headed monster, I'm apologizing to her for posting it here. ( Even though logically to you guys it's a story, you don't know us so it shouldn't really bother her because it's not like I'm going to my moms house....Pun intended.*

Also, this conversation just has never really been brought up personally between us. I never thought about bringing it up because I've seen it normal since i was 10 years old. And she just never brought it up either.
I am 25 years old, she is 23.

**EDIT 7** I have not read all of the comments posted, to many for me to keep track of, but I know It pisses me off when I read a story that is happening, and the author doesn't update it, so i'll do my best to update it and keep it private at the same time. So, I go home, unlock the door, try to open it. The little chain is on the door. Her mom comes towards the door and says hi with the stupidest, smuggiest look I have ever seen in my life. ( Her mom never liked me to begin with ) and says ""that's disgusting"" straight away, and walks away from the door, leaving the fucking chain in. I'm not the kind of guy to lose my temper, specially when it's regarding women, but me and her mom have never had good blood between us so the way she said it pushed me over the edge I guess.... Well anyways, she walks away and I kick the door and break the stupid little chain and I told her in a louder then average voice that it wasn't her fucking business, and I needed to talk to her daughter in private... ( to clear things up between us ), sooooooooo she gets her bag, calls Ashley over and she calls me an aggressive sex deviant. Then she tells Ashley "" we're leaving "" and I look at Ashley, then ask her if she's actually going to let things get to this point over nothing, after everything we've been through. She say's ""you didn't have to kick the door open like that Dom, you need some time to calm down "" and they leave.


And that's where I now draw the line. I'm done with this, you, and your mom Ashley. I've done nothing but be nice to you, treat you with respect, ALWAYS go out of my way to make, and keep you happy. You should honestly let her read this thread so she can realize what a fucking CUNT she is. Tell her to stop using the fucking tanning bed because her skin looks like the leather off of an Alligators asshole. I kicked the door open because it's MY FUCKING APARTMENT. Honestly I'm glad you caught me making my baldie puke, because if it wasn't for this I wouldn't have realized how much like your mother you are. My phone is OFF, don't call, or text me. I'm going to SMOKE AND MASTURBATE ALL NIGHT.

**PRE-8 Update**
For all of you who say this is fake, I would like to help you guys out. Tomorrow morning I'll take pictures of the door incident and post them here as update 8. I still have my phone off, so no updates on her. I haven't even touched gtalk or msn either. Now, I would also like to say that if she does message me tomorrow, I am definately going to consider what she has to say, because we have been together for a long time and I have never seen this side of her, shes still someone special to me. As mad as I may get those kinds of things don't change overnight. But don't get me wrong, if she tries to defend any of her actions I will, as you guys say, masturbate on her things, while looking directly in her eyes,** like a boss**. (joke)
Maybe she will realize it was an extreme over reaction and come to her senses. If not honestly the thought of being single is not that bad of a thing. 

Good night for now redditors, and reddettes. Thanks for everything, if this post is still going in the morning i'll make sure to post an update on the situation. If it gets boring i'll just leave it be.


**Update 8, and probably the last update**

I did as planned last night, even though I felt like shit about it. It hit me that I could seriously lose someone I care about, over something miniscule.. It's just eating at me, even though YES I know she's at fault, she may be immature, she's over reacting, she's socially uneducated about the general populations ( including my own ) beliefs in certain things, but she's also an amazing talker/listener, fun person to be around, she's smart, witty , and i'll stop now before this gets too stupid.

So yea, I turned my phone on, and there were 5 messages. The first two we're ""we need to talk please call me ""
the other two were ""call me now Dom I'm serious "" and the last one stated that if I can so easily turn my phone off and vent about our relationship on reddit instead of talking to her then we need to take some time apart to re-evaluate things. ( Now I know most of you will say ""See, you shouldn't have been immature and turned your phone off"" but the truth is, had I not done that I would have said things I probably would have regretted, she may have as well in return. I wanted to wait for me to calm down before talking to her.... evidently that was a mistake, and now she will be coming over on Saturday to pick up some of her stuff with her mother. Maybe it's for the best, and maybe you guys are right and I did dodge an emotional trainwreck of a bullet ( which I still find hard to believe due to how our relationship was prior to this incident )  but it still feels like SHIT. It feels like theres a blender inside of me. This is it Reddit, you have just witnessed a relationship go to hell due to an overly obsesed piece of shit mother who will ruin her daughters life if she doesn't realize what she's doing.
I feel helpless right now... I'm still kind of like ""wtf... ?""
I'm tempted to publicize her mothers contact information so that you guys can have a go at it. But after reading some of the comments left here, I will indeed take the high road and let it be. No work today, and i'm single.. So I'll just smoke away my *stupidity* of feeling bad and play the 2 shitty games I have on steam ( CS and CS:S I think ? ) :/.  IF any of you redditors would like to join me in steam, don't hesitate to add me if you don't mind playing shitty games to pass time, my steam account name is; Fjufju


And I bid you farewell, from this post at least. I'll always be amongst you redditors upvoting and spending 69 sleep hours a week on reddit. Thanks for everything, the insightful posts, the comments that made me laugh, and even the harsh-reality posters. I guess I need to *open my eyes.*

One last time, for reddit.

250,AskReddit,"Who here hates celebrity news, gossips, scandals, and other useless information about them?","Seriously?? I'm the guy who honestly, doesn't give a crap about almost anything. I think it's for the best, because I'm never angry, I never get into fight with anyone; I avoid many life problems like that... But recently I have discovered that I'm getting really pissed off at people who are fascinated by celebrity gossip. I have a lot of favourite actors and musicians, but I couldn't care less about their personal life. For me, to be interested in something like that and chat about it so casually is pretty much shallow... And paparazzi? pathetic...

253,AskReddit,I think someone may be living in my attic......,"**Regarding missing information.... I do not know what happened I messaged mods about it a few hours ago when 1/2 my post disappeared along with 2000 comments...... I just woke up from a nap and checked my phone, luckily my browser still had the page open so starting now I am going to start transcribing the info from the phone to the post.** DONE. Everything reposted.

---------

So I may just be paranoid.... but I came home last night after being gone all day to find my exterior garage door keypad was left open, my remote then would not close the garage door, the garage door remote when I clicked the close button would just flash the light on the garage door opener three times. The door did close when I pressed the wall opener.

Now this alone is not that big of a deal, weird stuff happens with electronics. But then my mind started racing with all of these things that have happened over the years so I started thinking about those things and went to investigate around my Town House. 

I present to you my list of evidence to you, convince me I am crazy or tell me I’m not. Regardless give me some ideas on how to test if there is someone in the attic.

* I have never been in the attic, I tried to open it once.... I had a step ladder and I could not get enough leverage to lift it up, it seemed stuck so I just put the box in my extra bedroom.
* I investigated the attic entrance last night and noticed 3 scuff marks on the wall, a finger print on the door below the attic entrance (There was also a fair amount of dust that had dropped from the attic entrance onto the door that is where the fingerprints were.
* I have never noticed anything out or place or food or drink missing.
* The only exception to this is the door knob on the door that goes out to the garage. I noticed on day that it was coming apart. I had assumed that I had simply slammed the door while leaving and broke it myself but I have no recollection of anything like that. Yesterday when I come home the door handle looked more broken. I rarely lock this door. 
* Twice that I can think of I have heard a loud noise upstairs, when this happened I slowly found a big knife and went upstairs to look around, each time something had fallen down, a closet door once, and some boxes the other time
* I live alone, and work crazy hours. Often 7 AM to 10 PM and another 8 hour days on weekends (I love my job) So there is plenty of time for a person to exit and enter the house.
* I never did a home inspection when I purchased the property because of time constraints with a tax credit. As such since the last person moved out the attic has never be accessed....
* Speaking of the previous resident. The property was a short sale..... and was being rented to someone for $100 a month. When I went on a tour of the house the house simply had a sleeping bag and some clothes in a bedroom.........
* I have lived here for 1.5 years.

Holy shit I think my have just convinced myself, but I feel crazy calling the cops cause all of the evidence can be explained in one way or another. But there is no way in hell I am knocking on the attic door. What can I do to prove someone is in my attic?

I just ordered a Wireless IP camera system but it will not be here to Tuesday.

**Update #1 Just called the Cops, So yeah....... This is either going to make me feel like an idiot or make me freak out cause someone is living in my attic**

**Update #2 Well this sucks. I only own a step ladder. As such the Deputies listened to my story, stood on the step ladder and could not climb into the attic....... Then they told me its probably nothing and suggested I replace the locks, reset the garage keypad entry, and put tape on the attic door or nail it shut.**

**So...... I guess I am where I started........ but feeling more like an idiot. The deputies did appear to understand my concern that was nice.**

**Now to tape the shit out of that door, close the door the bedroom, and build a fort of boxes in front of the door. And I guess I am borrowing a ladder from work tomorrow.**


* **Update #3 1:19 AM ----- I finally went back up stairs, taped the door, closed the door to the room where the attic entrance is, taped that door, and positioned a bunch of heavy stuff that will fall if they open it. I am not trying to trap the person in, I just want to know if they left. I also setup a USB webcam on my computer downstairs that will record to a online location if it detects movement. I also deactivated the keypad on the garage door. I am now going to my workplace, I will be returning after work, with a ladder and coworker with a handgun, and a tripod with a videocamera and a led strip to provide lighting.**

* **Update #4 2:07 AM ----- I am now at work, in my locked office, with the door looked and the building security system on and honestly kinda still freaked out about this whole thing. I'm going to try and get some sleep......... **


* ** Update #5 12:07 PM ----- I am at work right now, but since so many people are asking for an update..... I got here at work and sat in my office locked with the security system on and I was honestly still freaked out and could not sleep. I took that time to get a tripod setup with a flashlight and video camera so I can look up there without having to put myself in much danger. I am going home early today so expect the next update to be around 6 PM CST. **

* ** Update #6 5:33 PM ---- Going upstairs to check this out.

-------------------
Update #7 6:12 PM CST (Sorry for not including this before). I headed up stairs with a ladder and camera attached to a tripod and light attached. I was honestly too embarrassed to ask a co-worker to come and help me look so I took the advice of my fellow Redditor's and I manned up. I went up stairs and used the ladder to move the hatch, and then I used the camera to look up there without having to stick my head up there. **And....... There was nothing** I climbed up the ladder and had to stand on the 2nd to the top rung to see over the ledge(I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall).......... **And there was nothing.**

So end of the story is there is no one in my attic. Would I have done anything different if I could redo this entire experience? YES.

I tell people all of the time to stop letting fear hold you back and cause you to be inactive. So why did I not just act? Call the cops earlier? Get a ladder sooner? Find a Camera? Do something but give in to my fear........

Thank you Reddit for your jokes, your distractions, your honest advice, and your motivational rudeness. I think in some way, shape, or form I needed all of it. As my Thank You to each one of you I promise to read each and every comment and take them to heart, but even more so I promise to be a man of action, not inaction.

255,AskReddit,Have any of you realized that you were the crazy boy/girlfriend?,What did you do?  What caused your clarity about how nutso you were?
257,AskReddit,"If you were given a choice by your boss, would you work 4 days a week (10 hours a day) and take a three day weekend every week? ","For those of you who work M-F, 9-5.  

EDIT: Sorry if this is kind of a poll-type question, but thought it was thought-provoking enough that it was worth asking. 

EDIT: Wow, 2,000+ up-votes in 3 hours. I guess the question now is, since it seems that from this very informal survey the vast majority of the public would get on board with this, why don't businesses and the government try to implement this kind of work schedule option more often? I know I'd be a happier person if I had the option, and therefor be more productive when I was at work because of it.  

EDIT: Here's another alternative: Work 9 hours a day Monday-Thursday and have a half day every Friday. "
258,AskReddit,What's that small guilt that haunts you?,"Years back I used to visit a website where people would occasionally post little small fiction pieces. Short stories, or poetry or even songs, even though that wasn't the purpose of the site.

This one kid of seventeen would post these comedy zombie stories, and while the melodramatic horseshit posted by prominent users would have endless comments of adulation and love, this kids stories went unnoticed except by me. I would always post a little comment to let him know someone appreciated it. 
Others started commenting in time, but he would always send me a PM letting me know he posted one, and thanks for reading when no one else did.

In time I began to get busy with life. I found a job I hated but paid exceptionally well. More I worked, more I earned. I also met my now wife. I stopped commenting. 

I still got the PMs, but generally either ignored them, or replied with a thanks for letting me know. Read the ones I missed soon. 

One day I log on to the site after about a two week absence. In my inbox is a message from the kid that's unusually plaintive. Asking if please could I please read the latest story, as it might be his last and he'd appreciate the feedback, and if he didn't see me, thanks for reading it meant a lot to him. I ignored it, and didn't log back on for another good while. 

Eventually I log in one weekend, and think fuck it, ill read and stop being a dick. So I read them all and enjoy them immensely (they were genuinely good). So I PM the kid, letting them know how good they are, and keep writing. I don't hear back. 

Couple days go by, and I see someone he spoke to on the site chatroom and ask if anyone's seen the kid. There's one of those chatroom pauses where it goes from lines and lines of new text to stop. I get a private chat pop up with a Link to a post. I read through and its a post by the kids mum on his account saying he passed away a few days ago in his sleep after succumbing to cancer. I suddenly remember a while back he posted saying that his cancer had returned, but he was doing okay, but at that point he hadn't posted any stories, and he was just another username to me.

I felt shit. I still feel shit. I still don't watch zombie things because it reminds me of how if I'd have spared an hour I'd have probably made one of that kids last days.

261,AskReddit,[NSFW-ish] What's the scariest you've ever acted towards another human being?,"Now, let me begin this story with 'he was *totally* asking for it'. *Begging* for it, even. This happened not even a half hour ago, as I'm typing this from an airport terminal with my heart still pounding and a grin on my face. Before I passed through the checking I decided to take a bathroom break. Number two. Inside the stall there was a distinct lack of hooks so I instead draped my jacket over the door and thought nothing of it. Now, I was just wiping up when I *felt* somebody enter the bathroom. Then I heard a pair of feet walk in front of my stall. Then I saw someone peek under the door. My legs snapped closed but the face was gone as soon as it was there. Then my jacket was gone as well. The man had pulled it from the door. Now, had it just been my jacket, I might have cursed the guy to seven hells, finished my shit and reported the offense. But my boarding ticket was in the pocket. This changed the game completely. Pants still around my ankles, was up in a second and shouldering the door open in even less time. The door caught the thief on either the back of the legs or the ass, no matter which one, he stumbled into the sink. I followed suit and caught him around the neck with one arm, the other reaching over his shoulder to snatch at my jacket. He was wearing gym shorts. I was wearing no shorts. My dick was flopped against the back of his leg. We seemed to both realize this at the same time, but I reacted first. Taking a gamble that could have resulted in myself using the female restroom from that point on, I neither retreated nor adjusted, instead squashing myself against the guy all the more and, mouth very close to his ear, began shouting **""YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS.""** over and over again. He choked out the bastard child of ""what the fuck"" and ""jesus christ"", cast my jacket upon the floor and tried to shake me off. His hostage free from harm, I allowed him to do so and he ran out. I managed to retain my decency before anyone else came in and, half an hour later, here I am.

**TL;DR, humped a would-be thief's leg into submission.**"
262,AskReddit,"Today, my mom slipped on ice and broke her ankle. The person whose house she fell in front of came out and yelled at us when I came to help, saying I wasn't her son and how dare I use his driveway. Reddit, what moments have you had where you just thought, ""What the fuck is wrong with you!?""","Title pretty much says it all. My mom slipped and it looks like her ankle is broken. I got there to help, pulled my car into his driveway to back it up next to her on the street, and he came out and yelled at us. My mom told him that I'm her son and she called me to help, and he just kept yelling about how he saw us from his roof(?) and wondering what I was doing using his driveway. After that, we just decided to ignore him, since we had bigger problems to deal with. But, in my mind, I was just thinking ""Why does it matter who I am or why I pulled into your driveway? You can see her on the ground, you can hear her screaming in pain, does it really matter right now? What the fuck is wrong with you?""

If anyone's actually interested, I'll update when I know anything more, but she's just at the ER right now with my dad, I expect she'll just come back with a cast on her ankle, nothing too out of the ordinary.

Any interesting stories from reddit about people being just downright idiots about things that don't matter?

Edit: My mom just called me telling me to go take a picture of the ice patch she slipped on. I think he's gonna be paying

Edit 2: Her ankle was broken in 3 places, and she's going into surgery. She won't be home today, unfortunately.

Edit 3: I never said she was going to sue, I am inferring that. Don't freak out about it, if she does sue, I'll let you know

Edit 4: Since I just got back from classes and stopping at the hospital to see my mom (she'll be fine, btw) I can finally show you pictures of the sidewalk. Yes, it was actually more watery than icy. And, remember, these pictures are taken at extreme angles so that the sky reflects off of the sidewalk. From a normal, walking point of view, it just looks like darkened sidewalk that just had snow shoveled off of it.

http://imgur.com/a/VZRH2

Edit 5: just to make it a little more personal, http://imgur.com/BwgNc she got out of surgery and will be home today. She had a plate and some screws put it, and will have a cast on for at least 6 weeks, after which I expect a brace for some months, all of which will be without her driving."

264,AskReddit,Subtle jokes that make you smile.  Here's mine.,"Passengers on a plane are waiting for the flight to leave. The entrance opens, and two men walk up the aisle, dressed in pilot uniforms. Both are wearing dark glasses. One is using a seeing-eye dog, and the other is tapping his way up the aisle with a cane.

Nervous laughter spreads through the cabin, but the men enter the cockpit, the door closes, and the engines start.

The passengers begin glancing nervously, searching for some sign that this is just a little practical joke. None is forthcoming. The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and people at the windows realize that they're headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport.

As it begins to look as though the plane will never take off, that it will plow into the water, screams of panic fill the cabin. But at that moment, the plane lifts smoothly into the air.

Up in the cockpit, the co-pilot turns to the pilot and says, ""You know, Bob, one of these days, they're going to scream too late, and we're all gonna die.""

269,AskReddit,"Reddit, we lost something.  Can you help Sesame Street help figure out who played Gordon in our test pilot?","Here's the story, and [we're collecting info on our website, too](http://www.sesamestreet.org/parents/theshow/gordon).

Sesame Street debuted 42 years ago today.  But like most other TV shows, we had a test pilot.  We created it in the summer of 1969, just a few months before the first episode aired.  The actor who played Gordon on the show, pictured on the above-linked page (or if you that page goes down, [here's an imgur link](http://i.imgur.com/Ov6vr.png), was replaced by an actor named Matt Robinson (who, by the way, is Holly Robinson Peete's father).

Two years ago, we put together a huge anthology of our then-40 year history... and realized that we do not know who played Gordon in the test pilot.  We've asked everyone we could think of -- actors, actresses, and puppeteers who have been on the show since its inception; Sesame Workshop's founder, Joan Ganz Cooney; and of course, dug through seemingly endless boxes of documents and photos.  

Any clue would be great, even if it's seemingly esoteric or mundane. You can email it to us at wheresgordon@sesame.org, drop me a message here, or if it doesn't involve someone's personal info, leave it in a comment.

Oh, and one other thing: [Here's a clip of our mystery Gordon from that test pilot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHiEvVK5D-0).  And yes, Bert and Ernie look a little different than they do nowadays, but then again, [Oscar used to be orange](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/AEOrangeOscar.jpg).

**EDIT/UPDATE (9 hours after posting):  Right now, we have a lot of potential leads but nothing solid -- basically, it's mostly ""this looks like _____"" speculation.  I'll update this again tomorrow morning ET.**

**EDIT 10 AM ET 11/11/11: Nothing solid yet -- still all speculation.  Lots of leads to try, though.  Keep ideas coming via email!**

271,AskReddit,What is the biggest movie plot-hole you have ever seen?,"This one has always bothered me to no end.

In the movie G.I. Joe: The rise of Cobra the climactic final battle takes place in Cobra's underwater arctic secret base.  The team escapes and destroys the ice above them.  The ice then sinks, crushing the secret base.

Ice floats in water.

How did they not notice that in the script?"
273,AskReddit,"If major broadcasting companies released high quality TV show torrents WITH commercials in them, would you download those instead of commercial-free pirated ones?","I definitely would. Right now I find I'm constantly defending myself when people ask why I download all my shows. I personally do it for the convenience of being able to watch them at my leisure.

As a consumer, I would happily download a torrent straight from the broadcasting company's site since I know it would be coming from a good source, that it would be high quality and would be helping them pay their bills. 

Advertisements make the entertainment industry go round, I'm not oblivious to that. I'll happily be pitched to if the companies are willing to meet me and my lifestyle halfway. Chances are, if I'm vegged out on a couch watching a show, most of the time I'm not even going to fastforward through the commercials either. They simply just aren't a big deal to me.

The question is, would everybody else download torrents with ads in them for ""the good of it"" when there would inevitably be alternative options WITHOUT ads?

EDIT: For what it's worth, I am in Canada too. With Bell I pay $55 for 65 GB. I'm not sure how that ranks against American downloaders, but it's not the only way Canadians get the raw end of the deal with major broadcasting companies. Most of the streaming sites aren't available in Canada, not Hulu, not NBC, etc. If a Canadian wants to stream a show legitimately they'll have to do so through a Canadian syndicate (like Global TV, in a lot of cases). The stupidity doesn't stop there, though. I, getting excited for the TV season, tried to watch a preview of NBC's Fall lineup from NBC.com but couldn't because I was geographically restricted. How counterintuitive is that? As I said above, they just have to meet viewers halfway..."

 - Go somewhere quiet, as prison is never quiet. Alone usually too, and in nature is good.

 - Lots of new clothes, or at least ""new"" second-hand clothes. I'm thinking about opening up a second hand clothes store near a prison now. 

 - Watch ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Con-Air"", ""Family Guy"", ""Les Misérables"", ""Blues Brothers"" and a few ""The Fugitive"". One mention of ""Blue Streak"", which I agree is a little underrated (or is saying ""it's ok"" makes it overrated for a Martin Lawrence movie?)

 - Let's add ""Monopoly"" to that list as well. And it seems my mother is just as attracted to ex-cons as she is to X-box live players. "

Now, I am a student myself but I still want to give her something special. So I searched for a great used laptop , and I found a decent Toshiba Satellite. I sold my PSP and some other things so I can afford it.

So there we were at the dinner table opening presents. She opened mine and has this grim look at her face.
""This is it? I thought you'd buy me a brand new one""

""You know I can't afford it. It's the best I can do.""

""I want a brand new one, not this. This sucks! Worst present ever!""

She then shoved the laptop and box across the table and fell down the floor.

I picked it up, and walked out. My cousin tried to stop me, I just said ""I would never give her anything again.""

She even had the nerve to call back and asked for the laptop. Apparently her parents punished her for her behavior and she will now have to buy her own things. No hand-outs or gifts. 

My friend bought it as a favor. He helped me pick it out, and knows how much I bought for it. The profit was only $10(roughly)

What's the most ungrateful thing you see someone do?

**UPDATE: Niece called this morning, asking for the laptop, because she will need it for college and her parents told her she will never be handed-out stuff while she is in college. No apology yet, only demands. Her brother said I would cave and give it to her. Fuck no, and fuck you niece.**

This is exactly what I was referring to. There should be a general handy skills class, perhaps as an elective or something similar, that teaches technical aspects to everyday technology/activities in a useful way. Automobiles, wiring, plumbing, maybe a bit of wood and metal shop, maybe even a bit of finance and cooking etc. Things that people have to do as adult automobile and home owners, but don't really get prepared for through regular schooling.

I wrote a message, is this okay to send? I decided I don't want to come off as bitter or angry. But I don't want him to still have hope of some kind of hallmark movie ending either.

Dear Jack,

I am 24 years old. I am not the little boy who cried when you left. I am a man, with a son and daughter of my own. I've never spent more than a weekend away from them. I am a father and a damned good one. I don't need you anymore.

Once, I needed you. When my mom died, I really could have used a dad. I could have used anybody. When she died, there wasn't even anybody there. No one cared about us. I spent three days in that apartment, eating toast and just waiting for her to wake up. 

And then they called you. Because you were my dad. You were twenty three, young, but not so young really. If you had came and gotten me, you would have had a son. I would have loved you forever. 

But you didn't. So I went to a bunch of people who didn't love me, but liked the check they got with me. It didn't make them treat me well. I have burn marks on my arm and I still can't spend time in closed in dark spaces after being shut in closets. An afternoon is a long time when you can't count. 

I didn't count on anybody. I used to pray, the way mom did with me when I was little. But after praying for someone to come and rescue me, long enough, hiding under my bed and praying that my foster dad wouldn't come in and would leave me alone for just one night. Just one night. I stopped believing in most things.

I lived in seven different homes from 4-16. And even the decent ones, I was never family. I didn't have real birthdays or christmases. I wasn't allowed to go in the fridge and just get food when I Was hungry.

When I was 16 me and my foster dad got in a fight over a ham sandwich. ""Boy, what are you doing in our things?"". And so, I left. Sixteen, with nobody to call, and 40 bucks. I just walked away with a backpack. Anything could've happened to me.

But I made it. I'm a man now. And I don't need you. I don't want you to feel bad. I just want you to know why I can't be your son. I'm 24 and have never been any one's son. I don't know how. And I just don't have it in me.

319,AskReddit,"Can anyone help me find a film of another marine and I dancing in front of a marine film crew after we beat the Japanese on Ngesebus Island, September 29th, 1944?","Or you could say, September 28th, 1944, because I've seen films and photos from the war that were still dated on United States time (a day behind) as we fought on the other side of the world.

So, the true dates we were on Ngesebus was the 28th and 29th of September.

See, we made another amphibious assualt from Peleliu to Ngesebus to neutralize that island, as well.  After we handed off the rest of the island to the army, there was a film crew right on the beach filming us getting into the amtracs, on our way back to more fighting on Peleliu.

When Seymour Levy and I saw the film crew, we broke rank for about a minute and started cutting up for the camera.  The dance?  It was called ""Truckin'"" in those days.  It was probably the last ""fun"" moment we had before losing it all forever.

I think the film exists because someone claims to have seen it a long time ago.

At any rate, the film would be worth a lot to me, to see myself again at 20 years old with a very good pal of mine.  I've looked at the Critical Past and various other internets, but I have not found it.

This would be a **friendly** place to ask questions, when Google and Wikipedia still don't make it clear. A place to ask questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored. While r/askreddit sometimes has submissions like this, the VAST majority of the subs there are more in the vein of asking for advice [like this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j1rsq/i_just_found_this_piece_of_artwork_sitting_on_top/) or questions that are rhetorical in nature [like this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j25pj/soare_we_over_google/) I want a place specifically for asking the community questions about current events or other topics you'd usually be afraid to ask.

A great example of a question here would be: ""Can someone explain the deal with the debt ceiling?"" A lot of us may have heard a lot about it in recent news, and despite being fairly well-educated, might not really understand the basic concept. Here's a place to get an answer -- OR, show off your knowledge! 

The number one rule here would be simple: Respect. As a submitter (asker), you need to respect the subreddit by being honest and asking good questions. While there are no ""dumb"" questions here, please don't waste the space by asking questions that are clearly rhetorical in nature. As a replier (answerer), please remember that no matter how simple the question may seem to YOU, the spirit of this subreddit is for people to come here without fear of being condescended to (despite the catchy name of the subreddit.) All parties should politely contribute to the discussion.

All science-related questions would be kindly directed to the awesome folks at r/askscience (from whom I got the inspiration for this idea.)

I really think this could be a great place that would enrich our conversations on Reddit as a whole -- and, possibly even our own personal lives as well. This can be an opportunity to really expand your knowledge so that you can have more enriching discussions with the people in your life. That's the whole idea behind r/explainlikeimfive.

I'd love to hear feedback, thoughts, and suggestions -- and of course if anyone would like to help me moderate, that would be awesome. Thanks for checking it out!

**EDIT** Wow, thanks for the great response! I'm grateful for all the terrific feedback, and the couple of folks who've offered to help moderate -- we'll need you! ModMail me over at the new subreddit to let me know if you're interested.

As per your suggestions, I'll be adding a couple more rules for the sub:

**No Politics in your answers.**  DISCUSSION of politics is fine, but the blatant advancement of your political agenda (whatever it may be) is not for r/explainlikeimfive. Any such posts will be STRICTLY filtered. Take it to r/politics, please.

**No bias.** Like the above, there's no real place for this here. This includes religious bias, gender bias, or any other kind of personal bias that detracts from the sole purpose of this subreddit - to spread basic knowledge. These responses will be filtered also.

**Please, no blatant speculation.** It's okay not to be the world's foremost expert on a subject, but please, if you have absolutely no knowledge on the question at hand, please don't guess. 

**The above rules will apply to question-askers, too!**


**Submissions should be tagged something in the subreddit such as (LI5), so we'll know exactly what kind of post we're looking at.**

I'll be adding more of your suggestions as they roll in. In the meantime, if you do think this is a good idea, please subscribe and maybe fire off a submission if you feel so inclined. Thanks again!"

When I did he would always let me keep playing for another hour or two.

Later on when I started driving and hanging out with friends he would have me call in by Midnight.  I would always hit the phone 15 minutes early (so I could have time to be home by midnight if he didn't answer) and he'd always extend my curfew to 2am.  ""Just playing Megaman at Bill's, mind if I hang out a little longer?""  ""Thanks for calling in, be home by 2, no later and don't expect another extension.""  ""No problem""

His rules were very relaxed and he wasn't strict, but when he said he expected me to be home or check in with him by a specific time, he damn well meant it, and every time I did I was rewarded with equal respect.  ""Ok you got a thing going on, thanks for checking in, finish your thing and then come home.""  The mutual respect made it work, it made me want to follow his rules.

330,AskReddit,I heard all of the horror stories about the TSA but always thought it really couldn't be that bad. Now I just moved to the U.S from Ireland and the TSA has stolen thousands of dollars of camera equipment from me. Is there anything I can do to get it back?,"So I moved to the U.S a few days ago. We were originally supposed to go from Dublin to London, then on to LA where we'd spend two days seeing some sights then head on to Austin, Texas. Our flight from Dublin to London was delayed and we ended up missing our connection. After standing in line in London for about 6 or 7 hours we were put on a flight to Paris leaving the next day and then went on to LA. Our bags were never returned to us and we were told we'd get them in LA. When we arrived in LA we were told they were missing. With the delay we then ended up having to fly out to Austin (our final destination) a few hours later and couldn't do much about it. Finally after 4 days in Austin our bags were finally found and sent to Austin airport. 

When we arrived to collect them we noticed there was a huge hole in the side of one of them, the one which held our camera equipment. We checked it immediately but everything was gone. The guys at the baggage desk told us it was most likely the TSA who were responsible. We've tried contacting the airlines, but so far we are just being bounced around by all of them because of all of the different airlines we flew with because of all the connections we were on (Aer Lingus, British Airways, Air France and United, plus American Airlines who delivered the bags). We're also trying to get in touch with our insurance company in Ireland but we haven't had any luck with that yet. Even if they do let us make a claim theres no way they'll come close to covering the replacement costs. 

The biggest problem though is that we are in the U.S on 1 year work visas which require us to get a job asap. Every day without our equipment is a day we can't work. We can't afford to replace it and we just don't know what to do. 

Is there anything we can do to make this process go faster? Do we have any chance of recovering our stuff? Has anyone else been through this and can offer some advice? Do any redditors who work in the airline industry or with the TSA have any suggestions?

Any ideas or suggestions at all would be a huge help. I know it Halloween so I'm not expecting a huge response but we're just really worried since we put all of our savings into this trip and getting ready for it and its turning into a disaster. We just don't know what to do.

At this point we're both satisfied with the result of this fight.  So, we and gave each other a look and laughed hysterically, give each other a big hug, and we said to the cops that were just dicking around and that we were buddies.

336,AskReddit,How many of you still read books for entertainment?,"******Original Post Comment******

* Or do you not read as much now, as when you were younger?

__________________________________________________________________________

**EDIT ONE**

My comment got kind of buried, so here it is.

&gt;I read a ton on my iPad.  Mostly Sci-Fi stuff.
&gt;
&gt;I just read A [Soldiers Duty](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0441020631/) which was very good.
&gt;
&gt;[Wool - Omnibus Edditon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469984202/) was probably one the sickest books I've read in a very long time.
&gt;
&gt;Both are available in the Kindle and iTunes stores

**EDIT TWO**

What book would you recommend?  I'm always looking for new books to read.

**EDIT THREE**

My all time favorite book is *[Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah](http://www.amazon.com/Illusions-Adventures-Reluctant-Messiah-ebook/dp/B008IU9ZXW/)*, by Richard Bach.  417 of 538 reviews on Amazon.com are 5 stars.  Followed closely by *[Replay](http://www.amazon.com/dp/068816112X/)*, by Ken Grimwood.  Also very highly rated.

**EDIT FOUR**

Holy shit, I have A LOT more reading to do now. Thanks everyone for commenting! I've tried to reply to many, but my inbox has been maxed for hours!

337,AskReddit,The cyber bullying has gotten to the point where the school will not take any action unless I kill myself. Reddit- how do I get my story out and make this stop?,"He has been suspended until the school decides what to do with him. Thank you for your support and emails, but **THERE IS NO NEED FOR ANYONE TO EMAIL THE SCHOOL ANY FURTHER!!!!** The matter is being taken seriously now, and everything can move a lot quicker if the school isn't being flooded with email and concern. I promise you, action has been taken. Thank you!

I am not asking for therapy, but help in gaining momentum.

Since the beginning of the school year, I have been harassed both in-person and online by the school's ""bully"". It is hard to use the word because almost everyone knows and loves him. I tried not to let it get to me, until it escalated.

""Go kill yourself. No one would care if you died. Why aren't you dead yet?"" This was said to me multiple times online, and in the middle of class. As a teenager dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, I could not laugh this off. I went straight to the office and demanded to see a vice principal. I was sobbing uncontrollably and visibly a danger to myself, but they just sat me down and had me fill out a form. I called my Dad, who cancelled his flight out-of-town to come be with me. He was furious that he was not called in a situation like this. We had a conference with the vice principal, and we were told there would be consequences if it happened again.

It has been months. Multiple people have gone to the office with complaints about his bullying, and absolutely nothing has been done. Not so much as a detention. He is now attacking the leader of our school's GSA, members, and myself through twitter. Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided that I needed to go through his history to get hard evidence. Here are a few gems I found- some submitted by other people. There are actually over 20 screen shots.

""Life has its ups, and you have the Downs. Please do us a favor, and fucking drown"" -- A poem dedicated to Sarah.

""I have AP Lit in the morning. Sarah, if you say a single word, you are getting choked"" (I am the only person in the class who will participate in discussions without being forced).

""I was to roofie Sarah""

""Sarah has a boyfriend and I'm still single? Time to die""

""Sarah for biggest slut. Go die""


It is hard enough for me to want to be on this planet, and people are taking time out of their day to wish that I would die. I think this has passed what the school can do. They lost my faith when they didn't help everyone else who begged for some sort of relief after me. I live in Anne Arundel County. How can I get my story (and the others') out there so that we can see some real change before it is too late? 


TL;DR: The bullying isn't worthy of school attention unless I die. 

Edit: It's not just me. I have screen shots of him saying things about a TON of people who I am sure have no idea it exists. 

Going to bed for tonight! I will NOT let him stress me out to the point where I miss class. The other girl involved talked to people at PFLAG tonight, and they suggested board of ed. I might show her this page later. Thank you everyone, and I will be back reading your suggestions and updating you on my progress on this yet-to-be-named operation.

Edit 1: Front page? It was amazing to wake up to all this support! I'm on my way to a meeting with two other girls who feel equally trapped in this situation. We will have our proof with us, and we are demanding to speak to someone. I will let you know how it goes!

**Edit 2: HOLY S%&amp;^ YOU GUYS! I get off my bus this morning, and I see an unusual amount of cops around the school. I find the group who was going with me into the office, and we sat in guidance, waiting for the counselor to see us all (There were about six of us). Next thing I know, someone asks me if I'm Sarah. They had been looking for this ""Sarah"" all morning, and had even called down another girl by the same name. I get taken into one of the counselor's rooms, and a BOOK of these comments is placed in front of me. She tells me that she has gotten a ton of emails, and that the page has been forwarded to several teachers and the principal. I was shocked. Thankfully, she was not upset about the emails, though some of them were a little nasty. I learn that my Principal has been up all night trying to deal with all of the emails she has been getting. Though she seemed a little mad at first, we quickly settled everything. I was taken into a room with the principal, the counselor, and an administrator to share my story again. I printed off every tweet and the cops collected any threatening ones. They might be able to do something about it, which is amazing, because I wasn't expecting it at all. I'm still shocked that many of the school officials were just now learning about this kid, but I know now that they know: every body knows. Nothing can happen immediately, but the process is starting and consequences will happen.**

**I am slightly scared about the possible backlash, but I feel amazing knowing that even if people dislike me for it, I stood up for my own safety. I have a ton of support- both from you guys and my friends. Thank you everyone who sent an email (they kept mentioning some guy from Montana). There is no need anymore to contact the school or the county about this issue. I will be checking in every morning with the counselor, and she will give me a pass to see her if I ever feel like I'm being harassed over the next few days. You guys made this all happen overnight and sped up the process ten-fold! I don't think I can say thank you enough for helping me, and everyone else, finally deal with the school cyber bully. I love you, Reddit!!!**

345,AskReddit,[Modpost] Child pornography warning.,"Hi everybody,

I know you're all getting tired of the modposts, but I have a very important message for everyone in askreddit. 

Over the past few weeks, there has been a person (I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that there's only one person sick enough in the world to do this) creating new accounts and spamming child pornography in links on askreddit. 

To the users who have had the misfortune of clicking these links, I want to offer my sincerest apologies. It's not fair to you to be exposed to that, and **it's not fucking funny.** 

If you happen to stumble onto one of these links anywhere on reddit, please notify the mods of the subreddit and the administrators, and just be aware that this is happening (i.e. be *extra* careful when clicking links in askreddit.)

Thanks again everyone who has been letting us know and for your patience. Once again, i'm sorry for the excessive modposts. 

***
A lot of you have been asking about laws. I can't answer them for sure, but [slicklizard](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ur7n6/modpost_child_pornography_warning/c4xt49w) posted this article related to the topic. http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/08/11602955-viewing-child-porn-on-the-web-legal-in-new-york-state-appeals-court-finds?lite. (I Promise, this isn't CP.) 


***


Also for full disclosure, we're all going completely on the honors system with this. If you see it, tell us. We're going to be shooting first and asking questions later on these kinds of links.

We know that there's a problem because enough different people have let us know about it, but none of us are actually clicking these links to verify that it's CP. So please just continue to be honest with us about it. I'm sure you all can understand why we wouldn't want to make sure someone isn't lying about this kind of thing.

***


The question was asked if the offenders were using a typical image host. No, they look like they're using uncommon hosting (the last one was imagebanana).


***

I'm seeing a lot of blame going around to 4chan, SA, 9gag and even SRS. 

There's no reason right now to believe that this is anyone except one individual who needs treatment. Any accusations only serve as meaningless speculation, so let's please not demonize any of these groups.

***

I may not have made this clear enough.  **Askreddit is not being inundated with child porn.** You're not in any more danger today of clicking a CP link in askreddit than you were yesterday. Enjoy participating in askreddit discussions with the understanding that this is a forum open to any amount of people to post things like this. The mods and admins do care and we're doing everything we can to fix the problem."

351,AskReddit,"Reddit. I'm LIVID. Just got engaged with the GF and consequently was ""tested."" Family involved, details inside.","There's been a joke floating around Reddit/the Internet for ages where the husband-to-be is asked to come over to the bride's house for a favor. The bride isn't there but the little sister is, little sister tries to seduce him, he runs outside, and the whole family is outside congratulating him on not succumbing to her temptation. The joke being that he keeps his condoms in the car and was just going to get them...




Guess what? This shit HAPPENED to me today.

My girlfriend calls me over to help her friend (who is definitely not unattractive and I've known quite well for some time) with some computer problem. I show up and the friend tells me the GF ran out to do some quick errands. I ask about the computer and she starts bullshitting about how it's been ""running slow"" or some other non-point issue. 




Suddenly, the friend asks if I think she is attractive. I hesitate. Not wanting to upset one of the future bridesmaids I tell her ""of course, you're pretty."" She then starts telling me all this shit about how she has always had her eye on me, and how nice I was, and how hot I was...



I was kind of just floored. After that she fully came on to me. Went for the embrace, tried to convert to kiss. I pulled away, excused myself, and went out the door.




Head count: Mom, 3 other friends, my girlfriend, and her sister are outside waiting for me. They all laugh and cheer, the girlfriend runs up and jumps in my arms like I'm some sort of hero, and the mom has tears running down her cheek. They all kept saying how glad they were I ""passed the test"" and how ""good I was"" for her, etc. 




I smiled a bit, was really shaken up. In the middle of all the celebration I quietly said I wasn't feeling well, and excused myself. Got in the car and drove off (small burnout, it's what the Camry could manage), and have been hitting ignore on the countless phone calls I've gotten since then. As of this post (6:13AM PST), it's been about 12 hours since the incident and I still can't place my thoughts.




On one hand, I feel deeply and utterly betrayed. On the other, it's ridiculous to the point that it's funny and my girlfriend has never done *anything* even close to this before. Reddit, talk to me. What are your thoughts?




**EDIT:** (6:50AM PST) Wow, the initial feedback is huge. I guess this struck a chord with many people. I e-mailed her a little note that basically said I needed ""some time to think about what happened today."" I haven't slept at all so I think I'm going to see if I can get a few hours in and then go from there. Thanks for all the kind words so far.

369,AskReddit,How should a single dad handle his daughters first period?,"Hey I am dad of three girls. 10, 9, and 3. My wife, and the love of my life, died giving birth to our third daughter. So far after learning a bit about hair, girls have been easier then boys. Today my second oldest daughter Catherine got her first period. I haven't had to deal with this with my oldest yet. I haven't actually seen her yet I am about to leave work to get her. She had her period in the middle of class and sounded embarrassed on the phone. She is a lot like her mother smart but fairly shy. She is certainly not going to open up to me about this. What do I do? What do I say? If you were a young girl what would you need? I know these are childish questions but maybe I am a little scared and could use any advice. Ok I wrote this in a panic. Any advice appreciated. Wish me luck

EDIT::: WOW! i did not expect this level of response. i am honestly really touched. For everybody who wants to know my girl go; Sarah (10), Catherine (9, the lucky lady), and River (3). Their mother died giving birth to River. River is also blind and has slightly underdeveloped lungs, but she is also the best dancer in the family. 

Catherine took a nap when she got home. i took her out shopping and bought WAY too many brands of pads. we all built a cover fort and ate pizza in it. So far I might be a mess, but my girls are amazing and mature, and quite frankly i want to get older and be like Catherine. She gave more of everybody has their own time talk then me. 

I want to thank everybody for their advice, kind words, unwarranted compliments, and PM's. Catherine is a currently a Buddhist, I am an atheist but i let them find their own religion. I told her that i got a lot of advice from lots of nice people online. She wanted me to thank you all and wish you peace and happiness and a good nights sleep. I am obviously paraphrasing she is 9. 

From the bottom of my heart i would like to thank you all so much. I will continue to read and reply as i continue to be clueless. "

Apparently the teacher used to pick a girl in their first year and then groom them so he could have a relationship with them until they left the school. He only got caught because they were caught by one of her friends having sex in the school gym.
The worst part was that his daughter was a couple of years below us and she ended having to move schools because the girl who had an affair with the teacher was bragging about the details of the affair and said that when he got out of jail, he was going to divorce his wife and marry her.

378,AskReddit,What's something that isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be?,Explain yourselves!
379,AskReddit,My mom recently sat me down and told me the truth about my childhood friend. Can you help me research her story?,"When I was four or five years old, there was a girl in my class who had very few friends. My mom always told me to try to make friends with everyone at school, so one day I walked up to her and and asked her if we could be friends. I would play with her on the swings, and sit next to her during class. I remember her being very shy, but a great friend. I had so much fun playing with her, and we would make believe about swinging all the way out into outer space - we even made up a song. One day, suddenly, she stopped coming to school - our teachers told us she moved away to another state. I was sad to know I couldn't see her anymore, but I accepted that she had left.


Recently, while talking nostalgically about the past, my mom was able to tell me the truth about what happened to my friend.


Her name was Olivia, though we both cannot remember her last name. She attended Dallas International School, and was in the same class as me in pre-K (this must have been circa 1996-1997). I couldn't remember this, but my mom told me that Olivia always came to school in tattered clothing, looking very unkempt. My mom remembers that, when attending birthday parties, her mother would drop her off and only pick up her daughter many hours after the party had ended and all the other children had been picked up. These were little things that the other parents noticed, but that could very easily be concluded as an unfortunate financial situation where the mom worked, and therefore could not pick up her child on time.


However, one morning my mom was watching the morning news, and she was shocked to find out that Olivia's mother had murdered her children/family, and then killed herself. 


Reddit, I know that this happened over a decade ago, but it still deeply, deeply saddens me to find out that my friend died. I tried to research her story online, but I figure there must not be very many reports from the 90's. Also, because these are only my mom's memories, we cannot remember how she killed her children, how many children she had, etc. I know this is an extremely long shot, given how little information there is to work from, but I wanted to try my best to pay my respects to Olivia after all these years. If you could help in any way to figure out what her story is, I would be incredibly grateful!




** EDIT **: Reddit, I cannot thank you enough - within fifteen minutes of posting, Olivia and her story were found thanks to jacques45 and a few other posters several moments later. You have proven to me once again that this is a truly wonderful community, and I am very grateful! I am not sure where to go from here - I feel as though I am mourning a loss many, many years after the fact - though I know I can finally rest knowing that she will never be forgotten. Once again Reddit - thank you!


** EDIT 2 **: 2 hours and this thread has reached the front page of Reddit. I am overwhelmed with emotion, and am so happy that Olivia and her story have incited such a response from this community that never ceases to amaze me. I apologize for my lack of replies - I broke down after reading her story and have sought some immediate solace in the company of very close friends who have made this easier to bear. I will get back to as many of you as I possibly can. Once again Reddit, you are all truly amazing - never forget it!"
382,AskReddit,"Non-English-as-a-first-language Redditors, what word in English sounds hilarious to you?","I know a few words in other languages that, despite being normal words, are just funny-sounding.  What's funny in English?

384,AskReddit,"Apparently, I missed my wife's lover by only a few minutes.  I found out when she texted me accidentally instead of him.  Reddit, when did you know for sure it was over?","I went on a business trip this weekend and got home at 6:25AM.  I didn't want to wake her and the kids, so I sat quietly in the living room watching TV.  A few minutes later I get a text from her:

**""Thanks for staying over babe.  I love sleeping next to you.""**

Obviously, I wasn't here last night.  I'm still on the couch and haven't responded. I think she went back to sleep and has no idea she accidentally texted me.

-----------------

**Monday:**

1.  I had to go to work before confronting her.  I think it was better anyway, since it gave me time to think about what to say instead of rushing to anger.

1.  I asked my assistant to go to the 7-11 next door and see if they have Shiner Bock.  If they don't, I'll ask him to go as far as Publix.  For science!  (Edit:  we didn't find any)

1.  She finally texted me at work, and said that her (girl)friend stayed over.  I didn't respond.  (3:00PM EST)


-----------------

**Tuesday:**

1.  I left work last night and went to dinner with one of my work partners.

1.  I didn't say a word to my wife when I came to bed.  In the morning I mentioned the text after I woke up.  I told her I was surprised she would use that language with a girlfriend.

1.  She broke down and admitted that she had a (platonic) girlfriend AND an (not-so platonic) ex-boyfriend over while I was away.

1.  She admitted it wasn't the first time.

1.  I calmly told her I would have to think about how I feel about the situation and let her know whether we should seperate.

Thanks, reddit, you prepared me for the worst, way in advance.  It's nice to get the hivemind's opinion sometimes before jumping into a rash and complicated situation, or acting brash and angry as a reaction.  I really appreciate everyone's comments and help figuring out the next steps!

386,AskReddit,Cop here. I have seen a large increase in suicides this year and I don't know why. For my Cake Day I'd like to Ask Reddit to look out for each other and know that there are resources put there if you need them. And to ask Wgat can you do today to save someone's life?,"Let's try this again...

Traditionally suicides skyrocket during November and December.  In 2011 they didn't, and I noticed.  Then 2012 came along.  And people started killing themselves.  At the rate of 1 or more per week in my relatively small jurisdiction.

Roommates come home to find their roommates hung, boyfriends are shooting themselves in front of girlfriends, an adult brother called the police to tell us to come get his juvenile sister, who was sleeping, after he kills himself.  I've cut people down from doorways and performed chest compressions on shooting victims.

When I get dispatched to a death, I can't ""not click the link.""  I have to go.  I have to go in.  I have to see the result.  I have to handle the body.  I have to talk to the family.  I have to hear the screams and hysteria.  And I frequently have to bring those images home.

People, especially relatively young people, are killing themselves at what I consider an alarming rate.  I want it to stop.

Please.  If you are feeling like you want to hurt yourself reach out to r/suicidewatch.  Or call 1-800-784-2433 (1-800-SUICIDE).  Or call a loved one. Or reach out to [Befrienders](http://www.befrienders.org/helplines/helplines.asp?c2=USA).  And if you see a friend or loved one in need, give them the support you need.  This is my Cake Day wish.

Mods told me that like Jeopardy, my post must be in the form of a question. It's rules, as a cop I get that. 

My question is, what could you do today to prevent someone from killing themselves?"

&gt;I used to teach high school Spanish and I confiscated a note from a 15 year old sophomore once. I told the girl I was going to read it in front of the class as I unfolded it and walked to the front of the room. She was begging me not to like her life depended on it. I later realized why. I had no intention of actually reading it to the class but I wanted to make her sweat. I was going to make up some stuff like, ""I have the best Spanish teacher in the world...blah blah blah."" I was absolutely taken aback and stood there with a blank look on my face as I read the first sentence in my head: ""Hey gurl! You ain't gonna believe this but I'm pregnant...again!"" She already had a 1 year old. I locked eyes with her and she gave me this incredibly guilty look but she was relieved that I wasn't actually going to read it to the class. I was absolutely speechless.

I invite you to share your stories--horrifying, hilarious, dramatic, facepalm-worthy..."
403,AskReddit,What was Reddit's lowest moment?,"A mention of the Boston bomber incident in another thread got me thinking about this...

As a community, or sub-community as part of a subreddit, what was Reddit's lowest moment; a heavily public thread that made you feel almost ashamed to be part of the reddit community. 

EDIT/UPDATE: Well, that was some serious purging right there. Imagine if Reddit was a corporation like Monsanto or Foxconn or something of that ilk? This amount of scandal would cause a PR disaster. That being said, I feel that it's important to self-regulate in a place like this. Good job and thank you."

407,AskReddit,The recent problem with Reddit.,"The disparity and total two-facedness of Reddit has made me absolutely sick.

We all know about the [P-Dub asking for help thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ag96s/i_have_a_problem_and_i_dont_know_what_i_can_do/). Everyone donated to the guy who was popular on Reddit simply because he asked people to remind him about doing his homework. We didn't know the full story of what happened with his mom, nor did we wait to see what transpired. No, we donated $7,000 as of 24hours ago because we wanted to help.


21 days ago, a [woman who had similarly fallen on hard times](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a90vh/askreddit_how_can_i_pull_off_keeping_my_home_and/), a Redditer for over a year (more than P-Dub, I may add), was thrown into a pit. She also reluctantly posted a Paypal link (which she later removed). She was told to stop having children, Redditers were told to be a ""bit more skeptic and not just throwing money at people,"" and she was called a beggar.

Two people came asking for help. One made off with $7,000+ dollars, one got nothing. One got praise, helpful advice, and assistance, one got insulted and called a scammer.

Can we just ban e-panhandling altogether? The generosity of Reddit is amazing, but one of two things will happen if this continues:

1) People will become jealous, because someone got superstar treatment and help from Reddit because they were a user people ejaculated over, while other users in similar or worse circumstances who contributed just as much got nothing. 

2) People are going to start preying on our generosity in order to potentially make off with some money

The best thing we can do when someone has hit hard times is to give them our experience. We can offer words of wisdom as a lawyer, put people in touch with people we know that can help them, and even offer services to these people that they need at no charge. Scammers or unethical people will have no use with specialized help and advice, and the people down on their luck will be thankful for anything they can get.


**EDIT 1:**
Just got this from Shannonigans:

&gt;I know this will be buried if I just post a comment, but I just hoped maybe you could put an edit in there for me. No matter how many people were mean, the kind ones meant way more, I've received several gifts in the mail from redditors. Several stuffed animals, books, and a gift card, not to mention a giftcard to kohls to help. Reddit did about 1/3 of my Christmas shopping for me and the ones that sent kind words meant just as much. Right after my girls open their gifts, there will be a follow up with words of appreciation and recognition and pictures of the Christmas that reddit helped happen. I appreciate being skeptical, but I was really telling my true story. I hold no resentment towards P-Dub at ALL. If I could help right now, I would!

&gt;For now, a picture of my oldest and I with the card sent in stilesjp's care package of soaps (one of which she will NOT put down) http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v12/Shannonista/CIMG0278.jpg

&gt;Thank you, reddit, and thank you eggbrain, for caring. All the love in my immediate family goes to all the love for my reddit family.

**EDIT 1.5: (same time as the previous edit, but wanted to separate thoughts)**

I'm really glad things worked out for Shannonigans. I was disgusted when I saw her called terrible names (some of which, since this posting, have been deleted.)

Unfortunately, this doesn't change the fact that had there not been this topic, no one would have known about her, or any of the other unfortunate stories, some of which have been posted in this thread. I respect the right of individuals to make their own decisions as to whether or not to donate to a particular user. But I also think there is a responsibility of users to not just throw money at situations that they know almost nothing about.

I think it also teaches a bad example that someone down on their luck can get an instant solution in the form of cash without working for it (Which is why I think gifts of service and people is much more helpful). Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. Shannonigans had been working 2 jobs and was cutting down on everything in order to make things work. Was P-Dub even at the point where he had exhausted his resources?"
408,AskReddit,What's your favorite urban myth?,.
409,AskReddit,"Yesterday, I scolded a stranger in a Subway. Have you ever had to publicly scold someone you didn't know?","So, I went to Subway yesterday to get one of those delicious $5 footlongs. 

Upon arrival, I see three girls probably about 17/18ish. The first two order and the server asks the last girl what toppings she wants. She's on her phone so she doesn't answer. The server asks her again-not being impatient or rude-just asks. The girl snapped, ""Can't you see I'm on the PHONE here? God, you are so RUDE. Just wait until I'm done."" 

I was so offended and embarrassed for the server, so I couldn't help but say something to her, ""That was extremely rude. You came here to get a sub so don't yell at her for providing the service you asked for. Just get off your phone, order your toppings and stop acting like a child."" 

She looked at me with contempt and anger, but I think I intimidated her so she didn't say anything back to me. The server looked at me, smiled, and mouthed the words thank you.

Any redditors have to publicly scold a stranger? How'd that go?"

Today we made waffles while I'm visiting home for a week and my mom mentioned how she would just put Aunt Jemimahs back into the fancy maple syrup bottle and how I'd always say something like ""See mom? I can taste the difference"".

I usually always walk him to his car and help him put his groceries away, and he always tries to give me a dollar even though I've told him I can't take tips.

Today, I was coming back from break and noticed him checking out with another cashier. I walked over and said hi to him, and he smiled really big and looked super excited. He had bought some suspenders he wanted to put in in the store, but couldn't clip the back of them. So I helped him. I didn't even think about it, I just helped clipped them to his belt because it was no big deal. The cashier started giggling, and was like ""omg did you see that?? She touched that old guy!!"" And told everyone like it was big gossip. 

I walked him out to his car like I usually do, and when we got to his car, he stopped and said he had a question for me. He asked me why I was always so nice to him, and I told him my mother is a geriatric nurse, and when I was a kid, I used to hang out at the nursing home with her playing with the old ladies and pretending I was there granddaughter, because it made them extremely happy that someone cared. My mother always taught me to respect my elders, because a lot of them have no one that talks to them, or is even nice to them. I told him I wasn't trying to say he was a lonely old man no one talked to, but I'm always polite to everyone, especially the elderly, because that's how I was raised. He got teared up and told me I was absolutely right, his children hadn't spoken to him in years, his wife had passed a while ago, and when he goes out in public people treat him like a burden. He said I am the nicest person he had ever met at a Walmart, and that I'm the only reason he ever comes here anymore, and that he wished some people would learn some manners. He hugged me and asked me when I worked next, and usually I never tell anyone, but I gave him my entire schedule for the next two weeks and told him to avoid the times I go to break.

I just don't understand why it was such a joke that I helped an old man, and why no one else would help him. Yeah, he's a crotchety old guy who talks constantly about nonsense, but he's still a person. I hate my generation sometimes. I'm 25, and it blows my mind how many people my age are so blatantly rude to people.

The lesson for the day, be nice to someone. You never know when the last time someone was."

PETCO has released a statement, and deleted the facebook posts of people saying they were there to take the animals and denied.


Further:Further Edit:

I included Fish as some were salt water fish, and I am honestly not sure what could survive in the water that flooded the place, it had diesel fuel in it, sewer contaminants, gasoline from washed out stations, etc. Yes it was diluted, but overall not healthy.

By doing this, you can see that the PetCo is a known flood region, and also flooded in 2006.""

This shows pretty well that PetCo's statement that they didn't know they were going to flood is pretty much garbage. It's in the flood area of 06. 

My real last edit, as I had two teeth ripped out today, and need to sleep to go help family and coworkers with their destroyed houses and basements tomorrow: I'm in Binghamton.

443,AskReddit,Trolling law enforcement - what's your story?,"So I'll give my example here, I was reminded after reading the post about someone warning a kid buying from an undercover cop.

Back when I was in school, the University newspaper ran a story about undercover cops using a younger, cute girl to camp outside the liquor store just off-campus and ask people to buy her beer.  She'd give the people money, then ask them if they wanted to come back to her vehicle and share one as a way to say thanks.

Get back to where her car is supposed to be, van door opens up, cops inside, and you'd get a ticket for underage buying.

Later that evening, my friend and I were going to this same liquor store to get some beer, when we were approached by a cute girl, who asked us if we could buy her a six pack of beer since she was underage.

Being a dumbass, I said sure, took her money and we went inside.  About 10 seconds later I remember the piece about the undercover cops, and realized we were about to get arrested.  At that point, we decided the best thing to do was to buy a 6 pack of super expensive root beer (blowing $9 of the $20 she gave us) and we put it in a paper bag.

We walked back out, and she asked us ""did you get it?"" to which we said ""yeah, of course.""

She invited us back to her car to have one each as a thank-you.  Sure enough, we head to the back and there's the black van.

The door opens up, cops sitting in there with headphones on etc. and they tell us ""you're in a world of trouble now.""

I put on my best trollface and said ""really?  I really thought you guys could use some root beer sitting out here in that cramped van all night.""

There was an awkward pause, and then they opened the bag.  Root beer, nothing else.

Then they told us to get the fuck out of there, and we were interfering with a police investigation, and if we didn't leave we'd get arrested.

We walked across the street to our apt. building went into the various laundry rooms and yelled out the window every time she approached someone that it was a sting.  They left after 20 min. of that.

tl;dr - cops tried to trick us into buying beer for an underage girl, we took their money and bought them root beer instead.

edit:  For those saying this would have been entrapment, it wouldn't have been.

http://www.lectlaw.com/def/e024.htm

&gt;A person is 'entrapped' when he is induced or persuaded by law enforcement officers or their agents to commit a crime that he had no previous intent to commit; and the law as a matter of policy forbids conviction in such a case.

&gt;However, there is no entrapment where a person is ready and willing to break the law and the Government agents merely provide what appears to be a favorable opportunity for the person to commit the crime. For example, it is not entrapment for a Government agent to pretend to be someone else and to offer, either directly or through an informer or other decoy, to engage in an unlawful transaction with the person. So, a person would not be a victim of entrapment if the person was ready, willing and able to commit the crime charged in the indictment whenever opportunity was afforded, and that Government officers or their agents did no more than offer an opportunity. 

I would have been screwed, because of the three things required for entrapment, they didn't do #2

&gt;Second, the government agents then persuaded or talked the person into committing the crime. Simply giving him the opportunity to commit the crime is not the same as persuading him to commit the crime.

She just asked, she didn't persuade.  She offered the opportunity, that's it.  If I'd said no, and she proceeded to badger me it would be entrapment, but I just say ""sure""."

448,AskReddit,"Our summer intern is extremely lazy and spends far too much time browsing the internet and reddit and generally not working. He thinks we don't notice, but we do. How should we confront him?","So for the summer, we've had an intern. He started around June. He's a pretty cool guy, and he gets along well with the office. The first few weeks, he was fine. We gave him simple tasks to ease him in, which he picked up on. Over time, we gave him more and more, but nothing too hard or too high a work load.

Now, for the past month or so, he's been completely slacking off. I noticed the work flow coming from him has slowed dramatically, and he seemed a bit more lazy in general. So, I asked my friends in the IT department to give me a report on his internet usage. Surprise surprise. Browsing the internet, plenty of reddit, even some youtube here and there. All times of the day, at a high volume. When we last talked, I brought up that work had slowed, and asked why. His response was that he felt his work had gotten more difficult - which is BS, because he's very qualified for what I've assigned to him.

I'm not a tough boss, and I've never had to confront a worker before - our office has always had really great employees. So, how should I go about this? Give him a stern talking? A friendly one? A joking message through reddit that says ""Get to work!"" anonymously? He's a good kid, he's just been lazy lately.

**Edit:** OP has not abandoned you all, don't worry. As for all the comments about interns shitting yourselves - good. It might be you I call into my office later today or tomorrow. Straighten up, and get to work. The more I from interns here, the more I want to prank him!

Yes, I plan on talking to him either this evening or tomorrow morning. Yes, I will update. Some have asked how much he makes, and if it's for free: definitely not free labor - THEN I would probably understand. He makes around $18/hour if I recall correctly.

**Edit 2**: [The hour of reckoning is near.](http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/bwe/images/2011/03/prairie_dog.gif)

**Edit 3:** Edited the poor bastard's name out because the sound of so many interns shitting their pants in this thread is too beautiful. Unfortunately, there won't be time to call him in today - a meeting came up and I have other stuff to do by the end of the day. He'll be called in first thing tomorrow morning, and I **will** update you beautiful sons of bitches. Going to try and keep it light hearted, but at the same time keep firm that he *does* need to get more work done and that his browsing needs to decrease drastically. We are okay with some browsing, just not the amount he does. 

One last gem: called friend in IT, had him check again since he did earlier today. Looks like he  cleared his browsing cache and cookies, probably upon seeing this thread. Stay tuned...

**Edit 4:** Guys, we aren't hiring right now. I'm sorry :( Please don't PM me, I can't get you a job. If I could, I would - but you'd probably go on reddit as much as this guy. And then I'd have to come to /r/askreddit on how to deal with the situation. And then I'd get more PM's asking to be hired.

**Edit 5:** Really, we aren't hiring. I promise I can't get you a job.

**Update after our talk:** So, I met with him in our small conference room this morning. He seemed really nervous. Asked how he was doing, how work was going, etc. Asked if he had anything to air out, if he was happy with his work, interested in it, etc, etc. He gave me mostly small answers like 'yes' and 'no', while remaining a little nervous. So I asked the ""okay, well do you know why I asked you here?"" while remaining friendly, not stiff (heh) or anything. He had this shit eating grin on his face and said ""uhh, you don't go on reddit, do you?"" to which I also had a shit eating grin on my face. We laughed, and I said how browsing the internet is fine, and I don't want to have to monitor him, but we *need* more work coming from him.

So then I asked if he has trouble focusing, or is bored with work or whatever. It mostly came down his lack of focus, which I can completely relate to (I was very recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and we are close in age). We talked about things that would help him stay on track. I recommended getting up out of his cubicle every hour for 5 minutes, or walking around on our floor, and drinking plenty of water. Maybe take 5-10 minutes at lunch and go for a walk. He responded well to all of my suggestions, and I feel like the talk went great. 

Then I had to inform him where we go from here: like someone suggested here, I told him we're not here to baby sit, but to help him grow and learn as a programmer. We need to make sure his time is being used appropriately. If I notice another decrease in work, that's when the the punishments are going to have to get serious and I'm going to have to inform *my* boss about all of this, which will likely result in early termination. You know, to let him know we're cool, but we are still professional and work has to be done. I also told him if he feels like he's drifting again, or needs more assistance, to contact me before he goes back into this loop.

As we parted, I said to take 10 mins to browse reddit or whatever, and then continue on his assignment. Little did he know I had my IT friend redirect reddit to his own ""GET BACK TO WORK"" page, just for a short while.

I believe the problem is fixed. Thanks to all who gave input on the situation, to all interns who shat their pants upon reading this, to the few that sent me some seriously awesome FBI-level interrogation techniques, and to the many of you that inquired about jobs. No, I still can't get you one. I'm sorry.

**tldr: Thousands of interns produce brown fruit that flows into their sabatons upon reading this thread. Our guy was one of them. We're cool now. I'll leave it up to him if he wants to out himself here.**

&gt;""Look at her. Just look at her, walking with her expensive boots and jacket, all fancy. Since when are women allowed to make money, anyway? Look at her fancy ass. She probably has a great job and plenty of money, the slut. And we have to save pennies to buy cigarettes. What a slut.

**UPDATE 3:** Animal control would not take it because it is considered ""Live Stock"" and they don't handle that. So I just let go, nothing else I could do and I was tired of it using my garage as its bathroom. The odor in there is ridiculous. I had to spray it out with a water hose, it shit everywhere.

**UPDATE 4:** After some hours the little bastard has returned, now he is chilling by the garage and shitting on my driveway. WTF.

**UPDATE 5:** As more neighbors are getting off work everyone is coming over to see the damn thing, this is getting out of hand. I am about to start charging a fee to have an encounter with what I am now calling the shitcock. Also one neighbors dog decided to give it a go, he got his shit pecked. I might as well go get a goat and horse and open a petting zoo.

*To everyone giving me tips on how to scare it away, understand this. This peacock is not your average peacock. He has titanium balls (if male) and has the mind set of Rambo. Nothing phases it. You run up at it screaming, no fucks given. Send dogs four times it size at it, no fucks given and the dog will walk out bleeding. Spray it with a water hose, it enjoys it. Leaf blowers, loves it... I am not one for hurting animals so keep the tips coming but I am not going to shoot or harm it as many people are suggesting. We have also called around 5 different animal rescue type services and no one wants it, looks like were in it for the long haul with shitcock.*

I'd always try to hold it until I got home. One morning, my stomach started to rumble from Toaster Strudels. But, there was no way I was going to shit at school, and risk being caught and taunted as a school pooper.

Fast forward to gym class. Squeezing my cheeks together. The gym teacher is instructing us to do jumping jacks, situps, etc. Then, we have to ""skip around the gym"". I dunno if you've ever tried skipping while holding your ass together..

I'm skipping, then all of the sudden, my butt lets go. Instant relief and horror, as a huge turd falls out my shorts and onto my shoe. Still skipping, it gets tossed off my foot and across the floor.

No one saw me do it. But, it was soon discovered with a shriek by a female student. Then covered with a paper towel by the coach for the janitor to retrieve.

471,AskReddit,"I have a problem, and I don't know what I can do about it.","So, one hour after I finished my last final, my mom calls to tell me she has just been suspended. She was told that she would get the remainder of her contract, which is payment until August, and was then ordered off the premise. I thought this was kind of shitty, but at least she has 8 month's pay.

Today, the principal that fired her (she is a teacher), said they are breaching the contract and not paying her. Normally, this would be something she could take to her union, but she couldn't afford insurance *and* the union, so this was the first year she has not been in the union.

The first year she is not in the union, and they fire her on christmas and breach contract. She called her *old* union rep and he said that they are fighting this kind of thing all over the place, but they won't represent her because this is the first time in 25 years that she was not paying union dues. She was even promised by the secretary that was going to handle the paperwork that she would get full pay, on wednesday. That secretary was fired today.

The principal said, ""If you want to fight it, hire a lawyer."" 

I think that, collectively, we have 1,500 dollars between me, my brother and my mom, and the lowest that we have heard from a lawyer initally is 2 grand.

\*there is a *tiny* mortgage on the house (about 8 grand or so), but if she can't pay that, she is going to lose the entire house.

I don't know what to do, my mom doesn't know what to do, and my brother is in the Navy, so he is completely oblivious to the problem.

In summation, My mom's school district fired her, broke her contract because she was not in the union.

Frankly, I only post this here because I'm desperate I have no idea what can even be done.

\* I wrote ""I don't know what to do"" twice here. This is effecting my posting skills.

Someone has messaged me that they may know of a lawyer that could help, or at least write a scary letter.

It also smells really good. I tried it. My balls smelled like oranges for a month when I tried it. Maybe I shouldn't post that last sentence. Oh well.
___

Okay, I'm going to take a little break and check on things in three or four hours, I'll bring updates then. By the way, everytime there is a paypal transaction, I get an email.

I have 300 emails.\*

D:

\* make that 500 emails.
___

I thought I'd update you all on the plan that has come up from all this:

1. The NLRB keeps unions in check, and apparently what my mom's union has done may have been against the rules, and I have the form to submit to the NLRB concerning the union rep.

2. If the union thing does not work, someone has contacted me with a lawyer they know that may take the case Pro Bono (oh, how many times have I written that today and wanted to write 'Pro-Boner')

3. At the very least, a scary letter from a lawyer may do the trick and get the contract reinstated.

4. If all else fails, your donations will at least keep things afloat for some time.

5. Alternate 'If All else fails', taking this to the press. I list this as a last resort because I don't see my mom going for it. She feels really bad about the whole experience.

That is all for right now. Being Friday night, not much can be done over the weekend in regards to this whole mess, so any real action will have to wait until Monday. I think this is why they fire people on Fridays...

Edit:

Update Tuesday the 29th or Wednesday the 30th, everyone that donated will be getting an email from my mom (at least, everyone whose email I could find)

483,AskReddit,Hey Reddit... WE FOUND GORDON! ,"Yay!  Here's the story, and [here's a link to the original AskReddit thread, too](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m7g6k/reddit_we_lost_something_can_you_help_sesame/): 

In 2009, we put together an anthology of Sesame Street’s then 40 year history.  The end product of this anthology was a coffee table book, “Sesame Street: A Celebration –  40 Years of Life on the Street.”  The book is extensive – a full color, 300-plus page masterpiece.  The amount of research it took to produce the book?  A years-long endeavor, involving multiple people digging through a seemingly endless trove of boxes and bins -- all of which, collectively, promised to tell the complete story of Sesame Street’s history. 

Except there was one item missing.

In the summer of 1969, Sesame Workshop (then Children's Television Workshop) created an episode of Sesame Street -- an unaired test pilot shown only to a focus group of children. Later that year, on November 10, 1969 after incorporating the data gathered by this test pilot and many other sources, the first ever episode of Sesame Street – Episode 0001 -- debuted. 

The actor who played Gordon in the Episode 0001 was Matt Robinson, who held the role through season 3. In seasons four and five, Hal Miller took over. Since season six, Roscoe Orman has played the role. But the man who played Gordon in the unaired test pilot?  We did not know who he was.  And our records came up empty, the man’s identity, we feared, was lost to history.

On November 10, 2011 – our 42nd birthday – we decided to ask the Internet for help.  And congratulations, Internet: 

You found Gordon.

[Here's a pic of him from 1976, eight years after the episode was filmed.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvy8brgL7j1qcaggg.jpg)

Gordon’s name was Garrett Hobart Saunders, an actor local to New York who primarily performed in traveling theater.  Out of respect for the privacy of his family, we won’t be sharing the details of his life here.  But the story as to how we found him – how you found him, well, here it goes.

We posted our call for help everywhere we could think of, starting with SesameStreet.org.  We shared it across our social media accounts – Facebook (even on Elmo’s and Cookie Monster’s pages), Twitter, and Tumblr as well.  And we posted it to Reddit, where it quickly hit the front page. Within hours, people were making suggestions, and within days, the story travelled across the web and across mediums.  It even made a few television news shows, one of which ended up being the big break.

Mr. Saunders’ nephew saw a story of our search and immediately contacted his cousins – Garrett Saunders’ two daughters.  Both women reached out to us later that day, providing us the photo above and the other information we needed.  With their help, we were able to verify that Mr. Saunders was, in fact, the first Gordon.

We’d like to thank everyone who helped us spread the word and ultimately, solve our mystery.  And thank you, too, to Garrett Hobart Saunders, for being part of Sesame Street’s history.

**tl;dr: Gordon = found!**

485,AskReddit,What has been the most heartbreaking thing you've personally witnessed?," Today, while at work (library), a man came in and one of our regular patrons, a teen who's probably 15 or 16, came running up to him and gave him a hug. Turns out, the man is the teen's father. Now, through two years of seeing this kid almost every day, I know a few things about him: he's in foster care, his mom OD'd last year, he grew up on the streets, he was abused by several of his mom's boyfriends. 

So I was surprised to see he had a dad, honestly. But it became quickly apparent (to everyone else) that the dad wasn't that in to seeing his son. But the boy could not see that. He was talking all about his life, his group home, his younger brothers, etc. Then he says, ""Why don't we go to lunch? Let's go to Wendy's"" (right across the street.) The dad goes, ""Sure, let me go get my wallet, I'll be right back."" And he walks out the door and doesn't come back. At all.

This kid stood in the middle of the library for like an hour, then went back and forth between us and Wendy's for the rest of the day. A co-worker and I ended up sitting in the parking lot with this kid for like two hours after we closed, just letting him cry.

This is a teenager who has seen and experienced the very worst things, many of them probably at the hands of his father, and yet he wanted so desperately to be part of his life.

I've literally never felt so gutted in my life. All I want to do is tell this story to Liam Neeson, see the rage simmer, and then set him loose on this scumbag..."

492,AskReddit,What is a great and SIMPLE prank that you like to play on people? I'll start.,"This is something I've been doing for years, and it has worked for me about 30% of the time. When it works it's beautiful.

**Requirements:** A car with electric windows and a passenger.

When you stop at a stop sign/stop light and there is someone standing on the street outside of the passenger side window (perhaps waiting to cross the street), simply roll down the passenger side window. Done.

This causes two things to happen. 

First, the passenger will look out the window and wonder why it's going down. Especially when the weather doesn't warrant an open window.

Second, the pedestrian will take notice and look at the window being rolled down.

What then ensues is a gloriously awkward moment between the passenger and the pedestrian as they stare at each other without any clue as to what is actually happening.

503,AskReddit,"Reddit, are you aware how dangerous the ask-a-rapist thread is?","Hi all.  I'm a psychiatrist.  My main area of clinical work is emergency psychiatry, and my main research interest is functional brain imaging.  I'd like to start a discussion about the rapist thread, which I see as a serious danger.  In a nutshell:

* Rape is a crime which sometimes hinges directly on feelings of power over the victim.  
* That power often loses its meaning if the victim is unconscious.  Many rapists typically need a victim who knows they are being victimized.  
* This victim is the rapist's audience.  This is crucial.
* The audience gives the rapist pleasure, euphoric delight from unfettered, witnessed suffering.  That euphoria is intense and is possibly driven by the same neurobiology involved in a drug high. 

Now, when Reddit invites rapists to retell their stories, they offer an audience of thousands.  The possibility that individuals reading these stories will be horrified afresh is very appealing to some rapists.  It’s neurobiologically very much like anticipating drug use.

Note:  the audience doesn’t actually need to be horrified.  In the mind of the rapist, the possibility of horrifying an audience is what is appealing.

Ever wonder what makes addicts keep using?  A major factor is the craving that comes from recalling the feelings associated with the pleasurable activity or drug.  Cocaine addicts, active or in recovery, who are asked to think about using cocaine have measurable brain changes precisely when they report cravings.  We haven't actually measured this in rapists, but we suspect it's *highly analogous*.

Thus, the Reddit rape forum is very possibly triggering rape cravings in rapists.  

It is also teaching rapists how to rape better via shared stories, the same way we teach new participants to improve in any field, by sharing our experiences.

I plan to be available to discuss this, so jump in.  

(For those more curious about the guy behind the message, I'm a frequent guest on the [Caustic Soda](http://www.causticsodapodcast.com/) Podcast.)

Edited at 6:43 pm to eliminate gendered language.  My apologies for insensitivity!  I was pretty anxious when I was writing this, and my bias showed.  Any gender can rape any gender.

Fourth edit, 2:09 pm 31 July:  My point is that speech has power, and it can be dangerous.  I wanted to outline why it might be dangerous in this instance.  Is censorship the answer?  ~~No.  Responsible and accountable speech is the answer.~~  I don't know what the answer is.  That question is in the domains of law and philosophy, for it is a question of values, a question about how the world *ought* to be.  My point is about how the world *is*, and it stands whether or not there is free speech.  Also, yes, I fully agree that rape is a complex phenomenon with multiple motives.  I'm speaking specifically about sadistic, serial rape, which can indeed involve euphoria and the triggering of cravings.  I've made edits above as well to soften the tone.  Also, removed the distracting asterisks.

Fifth edit:  a number of people have requested links to research about rape and rapists.  All links are to free, full-text articles, so you can read in depth if you wish.  Here we go...

* Male rapists in this sample were [1.5x as likely to have been physically violent](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3365003/?tool=pubmed) to a female partner
* Male rape is [2x more likely](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256140/?tool=pubmed) in societies where gender inequity is normalized
* In this sample of 1686 men, 466 had raped a woman, and [251 were multiple rapists](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3247272/?tool=pubmed).  The most common motivation ""stemmed from ideas of sexual entitlement.""
* Men do indeed get raped and they have [enormous difficulty](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3067991/?tool=pubmed) disclosing this
* In this sample of 2049 men, [376 reported forced sex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3118408/?tool=pubmed), a finding ""consistent with assessments from Western countries.""
* In violent offenders, there are close relationships between substance abuse and consequent criminal offences such as ""[physical assault, rape, armed robbery, attempted murder and homicide.](http://www.hdbp.org/psychiatria_danubina/pdf/dnb_vol21_no3/dnb_vol21_no3_429.pdf)""
* Highly psychopathic individuals, including serial rapists, have [measurable differences in brain morphology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506560) compared to controls (Not available as free full text.)"

For background info, I did an AMA a while back on travelling around spontaneously with no travel plans (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/w85a6/iama_spontaneous_solo_traveller_ill_take_your/).  I mentioned in that last one I was leaving for another trip in the upcoming week.  

That trip occured this past July, and during it, I decided to hop on a random cruise ship to Croatia where I met this guy. 

We talked and after hearing how I had no place to go when I reached there, he invited me onto his boat/yacht. Over the course of a 2 days, we sailed around the Adriatic Islands on his private boat, drank beer and just talked. After we docked back into the marina, we said our goodbyes and the only contact I had with him was a single email thanking him for his hospitality.

This morning, I received this email. 

I still have no idea how to reply or respond to this, but its shocking to know that even the smallest gesture makes the biggest difference in someone's life.

505,AskReddit,What story do you tell that no one belives until you provide proof? (NSFW pics inside),"I'll start

A buddy and I went to Argentina for two weeks and spent 3 days at Iguazu Falls. If you have never been to Iguazu [here](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=793&amp;q=iguazu+falls&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=iguazu+falls&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.281.3172.0.3656.12.8.0.4.4.1.312.937.2-3j1.4.0...0.0.2PNQmAKuzFY) are pictures to do it some justice.

So we spent a full day at the falls doing the standard touristy trails and boat rides, absolutely breathtaking, and talked to a park ranger about finding a real adventure away from the crowds and he told us about this hike that is about 2-3 miles on a flat path through the rainforest followed by about a mile of downhill switchbacks to a lone gorgeous waterfall that you could swim under. 

The next day we began our journey and all the splendors of the rainforest were out: butterflies of every color, giant golden ants, toucans, camouflaged iguanas within a foot that were 3-4 ft long and much more. It was the one time in life I got why chicks got butterfly tattoos. 

We get to the waterfall and like a dream that came true there is a model photo shoot going on under this gorgeous waterfall. We were like two kids in a candy store with perma Cool-Aid smiles. Its 3 models, camera crew, a park ranger and us. We were in heaven. After playing under the waterfall and swimming in the little pond we were eating lunch.

I look to my buddy and said ""No one is ever going to believe this happened to us"" all he said was ""They are getting naked."" My head whipped around and all 3 were completely nude with the waterfall flowing over their bodies...I love South America. For the next 2 hours we sat there in nirvana. 

No one ever believes me, not even my mother, until I show them [this](http://imgur.com/a/pebcj) NSFW

I plan on documenting all this, taking pictures and video at each destination, and am looking to purchase a video camera-- can anyone recommend something lightweight?  Also-- **if anyone else has similar benefits you're welcome to join me for any/all of the journey.** We could take turns filming!

I intend on beginning my journey starting on May 7th and continuing into late July.

* B.Sc. in forensics

* American citizen

* I won't do anything illegal-- if you want a package delivered I'd like to inspect the contents first  ಠ_ಠ

She was great around all the kids and never hurt anyone.
Then one day this exceptionally dicky kid came up to ""pat"" my dog on the head. This pat however was pretty much just a punch to the nose, which my dog did most certainly not like. So she bit the kid on the hand (didn't even draw blood), and the kid made a huge scene after which my dog was banned from the school.
As we lived in a very crowded suburban area, the school oval/park was the only place we could walk her so instead of letting her never be able to get rid of energy we promptly 'sent her off to the farm'.

My brother, being 10 years older and very considerate, told me that the real reason we gave her away was because the ranger made us put her down, and my parents were just trying to be nice. I believed this for a few (very sad) months before finally travelling down south to my uncle's farm and be beyond delighted when i found out she was still alive.

So reddit, what's your lying-but-honest parent story?"
520,AskReddit,The best $7.50 I have ever spent...What's the best money you have ever spent?,"So, I walked into a Safeway today to find some Greek God yogurt, the honey variety and I stopped at the deli. A lady was waiting there. She looked to be an impoverished little elderly black woman (I am not being classist, or ageist or sexist or racist here, I just like to visually paint pictures) anyway, she said she had been waiting for 45 minutes and no one would wait on her. When they finally did, she asked the price of an egg roll and the fried wontons. It was evident she didn't have much. Finally in frustration, she said, ""Forget it,"" and started to leave. That just felt so wrong. I called out, ""Stop, stop, you can't leave, come back here. Pick your dinner out. I'll buy it."" It came to a mere $7.50 or so. The thought of someone walking home hungry, feeling broke and mistreated just felt so wrong. I told her that I had just sold a book and the meal was no big deal. She asked about the book and I told her about my friend, Darryl's cancer and how it was important to get it done to honor what a gift he is to me and how much I love him. She said that her husband had cancer. We walked out and I grabbed her a copy of the book and signed it for her. She said she had a book she was working on. She hugged me and said, ""I love you."" For a mere $7.50 I got an ""I love you,"" from a stranger. Best $7.50 I have spent in a long time."

525,AskReddit,How do I remove the smell of decomposing octopus from a plastic kayak?,"Title says it all.  We work in an estuary and an octopus got in the kayak a couple of weeks ago but we thought he had escaped.  Fast forward to this week when we realized he had died in the stern of the boat and was rotting up in there.  We have so far tried soaking in bleach for hours and a paste of baking soda.  What else can we try.  The smell is beyond the normal dead sea creature smell we are used to here.  
EDIT:  ok the kayak smells like bleach/baking soda/Lysol/lemon/vinegar/pine sol/  and most of all maggoty decomposing octopus so I just told the intern it is their kayak and we will buy another.

Happened back when I was 16-17. Was hanging late one night at an out of the way basketball court with 3 of my very attractive female friends. We were just shooting some hoops and talking when someone suggested a game of Strip Basketball. The three girls wanted to be on a team together, so they told me I could go choose anyone I wanted for my second. Naturally, I bolted for my highschool's basketball team captain's house. Pounded on his door at 10 pm, sweating and out of breath and said ""No time to explain, let's go,"". 

I didnt know him very well, and he had no reason to go with me, but we were both happy he did. The girls weren't happy with my choice, but they kept their word and we got a nice show.

530,AskReddit,How many of you will leave Bank of America once then start charging you $5 to use your debit card?,"I left Bank of America years ago and I haven't been more happy. Its been my experience that they always seem to find ways to suck more money out of you.
I left them because one day their system had a glitch where it said my balance was a certain amount, so I removed some money. Ends up I didn't have enough money and now it was Non-sufficient funds (NSF). Even though they admitted that their system messed up, I still got charged then INS fees and had to return the extra money. I had no problem returning the money but paying a fee for their mistake was what put me over the line because this wasn't the first time they said I had pay bogus fees for no reason.

Now they want to charge people $5 a month just to use your debit card. Do the math: BofA has 57 million consumer and small-business accounts. If a majority of them uses debit cards, BofA will make about $3 billion a year — or $1 billion more than BofA is currently making from transaction fees.

We bail them out and now they want even more money.

535,AskReddit,What advice can you give us young adults who want to move out and get their own place?,EDIT: WOW thanks so much for all the great feedback. Never expected to get this much response!
536,AskReddit,"My parents raised 6 kids. Nearing their 60s and never having taken a single vacation, I want to give them a trip to Ireland. Having not traveled, I don't know where to start. If you've ever planned a surprise trip for someone, what advice would you give to others? How did your experience go? ","  As said in the title, my parents have worked hard all their lives for their family. We never had really nice stuff but they always gave everything they could while putting off their own desire. I'm the youngest and now in my mid 20s, so my parents should be able to wind down and get ready for retirement, do a bit of travelling, etc. Unfortunately with their financial situation (+11 grandkids to spend money on), that won't be happening. 

  My parents always talked about going on a trip but it's never happened. Dad works for weeks at a time, staying in camps doing 12 hour days and only coming home on (some) long weekends. It makes me sad that he works so hard with no end in sight, so it's the least we can do to show our gratitude for all the love and help they've given us. 

  Originally I was thinking some all-inclusive type package where they can just relax but I'm not sure it's really up their ally. One of my brothers suggested Ireland (we live in Canada) because both sides of the family originate there and I know both of my parents have expressed a desire to see that country over any other.

  Some questions I have are: 

* What is the best way to look for deals on international flights? I know of expedia and that's about it. 

* What kinds of places would you want to stay? What cities are best for travelling? Are there any dangerous places you would recommend avoiding as a tourist?

* Is Christmas a good time to visit a country like Ireland? My sister also suggested their anniversary (in June), which still gives them 6 months to organize themselves but may be tougher for my dad as far as time off work goes. 

Thanks for any help!

*Edit 1* - So many insightful and informative responses! Lots of good points, some already considered and some not.  I will respond whenever I can, since I'm at work right now. Thanks Reddit! 

*Edit 2* What an overwhelming response! I have my reading cut out for me.. Thank you all foer sharing your advice and bringing up details I hadn't even thought of. For those saying it's a bad idea, it's not. We will ultimately do what's affordable and reasonable with the decisions on where/when left up to my parents. The surprise will be when we tell them that we are sending them on a trip. Someone suggested having a couple small travel gifts to give them at that time which I think is a good idea. I'm so excited to put this together, and want to thank you all again for your help and advice."
537,AskReddit,What is your biggest achievement in the past 24 hours?,"I encourage everyone to think about this and respond. I find it is a good way to figure out if you've been making the most of your time.

It doesn't need to be something that will impress everyone, just think about it on a personal level.


EDIT:
Now that I think that this post is just about to reach it's peak I think it is time for me to explain the purpose of this little exercise.

I find that many people that live busy day to day lives often don't have the time nor energy to take a step back and notice the little things that they have done, only focusing on the bigger things that they are about to do. The little steps that are over looked can often make us feel slightly proud of ourselves and can give  the boost that is needed to reach the overall goal, so when looking back on it, we haven't just enjoyed the outcome, but the process as well.

On the other hand, there are people who don't feel like they lead full busy lives. This idea of reflecting on the most positive thing you've done recently gives you a little pat on the back, showing you that you have been doing something no matter how small or insignificant you think it is.

In future if you ever find yourself rushed, anxious or just feeling a bit down and out, just think of this and every single time you do, you will always find a boost in your self worth.

TL:DR: Just think of this occasionally in future.

559,AskReddit,"I attended a private function where President Clinton was speaking.  His advice to the OWS was: 'Stop being against something and start being for something.""   Reddit's thoughts?","He was speaking in Ontario.  He is a great speaker and I was very impressed with his speech/interview.

EDIT:  Was quite impressed with all the comments and feedback on here when I woke up this AM.  Even the silly comments.  

Some answers to questions I have received:  Clinton was speaking at the Ontario Economic Summit in Toronto.
At one point he actually said that he feels he should be taxed more.  I'm not sure how this impacts discussions here, but some people seem to think this is a critical fact that is needed.  I don't think it matters myself.

I don't have a transcript or a video and I'm not sure if one will become available, if so I will share.

I'm not opposed to OWS, I'm not for OWS either.  Many people, including Clinton, have a hard time supporting OWS because it isn't entirely clear what OWS stands for.   It is too broad.  

I'm no longer a banker, I work close in the area of public policy, I'm not the government that OWS is opposed to.  I'm FOR distribution of wealth.  Though in my meetings that is not my direct message.  I state problems and offer solutions.  I tackle issues one at a time.  When I worked for a bank, I was NOT the 1%.  It is PART of why I left, not that I was looking to become the 1%, I just didn't agree with the direction the banks are going.  Even the CDN banks.

Clinton IMO was simply offering advice, I don't believe he was speaking out against OWS, in fact I think he wants them to be successful.  I could be wrong, he is a great word smith as some have said.

Another personal opinion:  If I judged you based on your past, specifically a 1-5 key negative elements of your past, would YOUR own advice be valid?  I know I have made some major errors in my past.  I agree Clinton has goofed up royally in the past, but I think he offers a valid point.  Also I feel that because OWS has decentralized itself, it also opens itself up to individuals who may be a little too right wing and they discredit the OWS movement.  i.e. those protesting things like oil in the general sense and are doing it under the OWS movement.  

FOCUS is needed and I personally believe that some sort of centralized publicity needs to take place.  I feel like OWS is trying to speak on our behalf as the 99%, yet I can't support such a disorganized cause that lets many factions speak on my behalf that I don't really agree with.

Anyway, I posted this to open dialogue, that was my only motive.  I'm not saying I'm a Clinton supporter or I'm against OWS, just helping set the stage for discussions on where OWS is going.  Cause I don't know and that makes it hard for me to share my support to them.  In my own town, all OWS has done is provide a home for the homeless, for now.

EDIT 2:  For the purposes of dialoguing the statement, I should have just left out who said it.  I feel like some of you are more concerned with who said it, than the validity of the point.  Great discussions here regardless.  Thanks everyone.  And I wish I could read ALL the comments, but there are far too many now.  "

572,AskReddit,"When I was 14, a random guy saved me from a potential kidnapping by pretending to be my boyfriend. I never got to thank him. Reddit, what random act of kindness motivated you to ""pay it forward""?","I was 14 and two girlfriends and I had gone to the theatre in my neighbourhood to see Ghost Rider (my first mistake, I know). We had gone to the 10pm show, so it let out around midnight. It's the only large theatre in the area so it's always filled with moviegoers, but there is very little staff and the hallways are deserted when any movies are in progress. This is all especially true for the late night shows.

When our movie finished, my friends went to the bathroom, as is necessitated by the female movie theatre ritual, and I elected to wait out in the secondary lobby.

That was probably my second mistake.

This theatre, due to its lack of staff, often has more people sneaking into the theatre than people paying for tickets. It is very, very easy to simply waltz in through a side door when another person is walking out. 

I was the only one in the hallway which made me a target for an extremely large, homeless/cracked-out-looking 40+ year old black man (only relevant because I'm pale as fuck and he could *not* pass as my dad). He was built like a truck.

 Generally I'm extremely outgoing and can talk with strangers easily; however, the moment I noticed this fellow approaching, an overwhelming sense of fear washed over me and my brain kept telling me to get out of there fast. My naive 14-year-old self decided to stay where I was, thinking: ""There's no way in hell anything bad could happen to me since I'm obviously invincible to the world. Bad shit only happens in the news. Don't judge a book by its cover, aphrodite_whities! He's probably a lovely guy.""

He approached and asked me if I had any cigarettes. I said no and that I didn't smoke, when he suddenly reached out and grabbed my hand. He stood there shaking my hand saying how he was just dying for a cigarette, increasing his deathgrip every time I tried to pull my hand away. He kept closing the distance between us while strangling my hand and eventually he had me backed into a corner, all the while he keeps fiddling around with something in his pocket (I don't know what it was; he never took that hand out of his pocket the entire time). He kept saying how he wasn't even there to see a movie, just wanted some cigarettes. He was insistent that we go get cigarettes and kept trying to steer me towards the side door.

I was so scared that I was probably on the brink of pissing myself. I looked to see if anyone was around, only to notice my two friends standing outside the bathroom door -- not doing anything while this man was forcing his body onto mine in a public place. They were the only people around and they were just standing there. Understandably, they later said they were confused as to what was happening and didn't know what to do.

Thankfully, a movie lets out right in front of where the man has me trapped. 

Every single person passed by without so much as a second glance. Shit, I thought, I'm gonna get kidnapped. This man wouldn't take his eyes off of mine for a second, and pushed his chest against mine every time I looked around for help. I was too afraid to yell.

Suddenly, a group of three guys (probably only around 15 or 16 years old) came straggling out of the theatre. They didn't notice me at first, but just as they were rounding the corner out of the lobby, one of them turned around and stared at me oddly. He mouthed ""**do you need help?**"", and I nodded as discreetly as I could.

The guy came running up and threw his arm around my shoulders, saying things along the lines of ""thanks for waiting, babe. You ready to go? That was a great movie, huh? I'm glad we went in the end. Who's this guy?!"" The man instantly lets go of my hand, keeping his other hand in his pocket, and backs away quickly, mumbling how he just wanted a cigarette, and then he ran out of the emergency exit at the back of the lobby. 

My guy escorted me outside, and I was in such a state of shock that I think I just hugged him and ran away to my mom who had been waiting in the parking lot. I had been so sure that no one was going to help me, not even my friends, and in such a moment of panic I was really not thinking straight enough to follow the steps I should have (i.e. yell for help). 

Ever since, I've made an effort to make sure I'm aware of my surroundings just in case someone needs help but can't ask. Haven't ""saved"" anyone yet, but only time will tell! The extent of my ""paying it forward"" is saving girls from bad situations at the bar, nothing heroic yet, but hopefully I'll be able to help someone out when they really need it.

So, Reddit, what has a stranger done for you that made you want to pay it forward?

**TL;DR: 14yo me didn't go to the bathroom after a movie, ended up wanting to piss my pants while being harassed by a man in the lobby. Random guy pretended to be my boyfriend, scaring off the creep and potentially saving my life.**

(I also just want to add, in case this guy is a redditor and remembers saving some girl that one time, a sincere thank you. It has haunted me since that night that I never thanked you for what you did. Thank you.)

","This just happened about 20 minutes ago in downtown Boston.  I was at the corner of a major intersection waiting to cross when an adorable kid in his Sox garb pulled away from his texting mother and try to cross on his own.  

By the time I realized what was really happening the kid was about 10 feet in front of an armored data tape truck which based on how high the cab is I don't think the driver could have even seen the kid if he was looking.  A girl who looked like she was about 25  stepped into the street and lifted the kid up by the arm and pulled him back onto the curb as the truck skidded to a stop.

I was shocked and impressed, I had watched the whole thing happened and in no way could have responded so quickly.  Well instead of thanking the woman that just stopped her child from dying in front of her the mother went absolutely bonkers.  She started screaming ""How dare you touch my child"" along with a string of obscenities.  The young woman kept her cool for about 30 seconds of screaming before telling the mom that next time she'd just let the kid get hit before storming off.

601,AskReddit,I hope this may help some of you since I see it asked so often: How EVERYONE can retaliate against the Westboro Baptist Church from the comfort of your home.,"Redditors frequently ask how they can counter protest or stop the WBC. Most of you are aware that they troll funerals with the intent of inciting a response. The ""Phelps-Chartered Firm"" is the legal arm of the WBC, located in Kansas.


Here's how we stop it: file a bar complaint with Kansas and get Phelps-Chartered Firm attorneys suspended/disbarred. Take it from a lawyer, a bar complaint is serious business and must be responded to. This is not an issue of whether WBC may express their opinion (they're legally permitted to do so), but whether the attorneys participating in this scheme are acting professionally and ethically. I contend that they are not.


**Step 1**

Print out a [complaint form](http://www.kscourts.org/pdf/complaintform.pdf) and fill out the required information. 


**Step 2**

The most important thing is to make proper allegations. Here's what I've come up with, feel free to submit or modify **(Edit: I would honestly encourage everyone to do their own research and determine if there are any other rules which you believe the Phelps-Chartered Firm violates. My letter is a template, not meant to be copied en masse. If you find the firm's actions disparaging to the profession, inform Kansas of your opinion in your own way.)**:

&gt;*This complaint is against members of the Phelps-Chartered Firm (""The Firm""), located in Kansas. Its members include, but are not limited to, Jonathan B. Phelps, Shirley Phelps Roper, Rachel I. Hockenbarger, Rebeka A. Phelps Davis, Margie J. Phelps. The Firm has violated the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct numerous times and continues to engage in acts which demean the legal profession.*

&gt;*The Firm is the exclusive counsel of the Westboro Baptist Church (""WBC""), with WBC providing the near-total source of work for The Firm. Every member of The Firm is a member of WBC. WBC is engaged in the practice of protesting high profile and military funerals throughout the United States with the purpose of inducing violent reaction against WBC members. The Firm is so closely involved with the operations of the WBC that it is an actual part of the WBC.*

&gt;*Members of The Firm have repeatedly violated Rule 8.4(http://www.kscourts.org/rules/Rule-Info.asp?r1=Rules+Relating+to+Discipline+of+Attorneys&amp;r2=2) of the Kansas Rules of Professional conduct. Members of The Firm have represented their client (WBC) with the knowledge that their client's actions will likely lead to an attempted battery or assault. Members of The Firm have conducted this representation with actual or constructive knowledge that their client's actions will lead others to engage in criminal violence against WBC, in direct violation of 8.4(a).*

&gt;*The Firm provides actual and constructive support of WBC's actions, which adversely reflects on the The Firm and its members' fitness to practice law, in violation of Rule 8.4(g). In addition The Firm's actions violate the Kansas Bar Association's Hallmarks of Professionalism as The Firm diminishes respect for the role of the lawyer in society and fails to respect all persons, regardless of gender, race, or creed.*

&gt;*As stated in the Scope of the Kansas Rules of Professional conduct, ""[t]he Rules do not, however, exhaust the moral and ethical considerations that should inform a lawyer, for no worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules. The Rules simply provide a framework for the ethical practice of law."" Members of The Firm have acted unprofessionally, unethically and counseled their clients to induce others to violate the law. To permit their continued ability to practice law in Kansas would be a flagrant disregard of professional guidelines and would put the Kansas legal community into disrepute.*


**Step 3**

Mail this out to:

Office of the Disciplinary Administrator

701 Southwest Jackson, First Floor

Topeka, Kansas 66603


Please be respectful, articulate, and professional. Bar complaints are a serious business and the goal of this is not to inundate the Kansas Disciplinary Administrator with paperwork. The goal is to present reasonable arguments and public support as to why the Phelps-Chartered Firm should not be permitted to practice law in Kansas.

**tl;dr** Make a bar complaint against WBC lawyers with handy instructions provided.

**Just to be clear (because this has been a recurring point brought up): This is NOT an attempt to infringe WBC's free speech. If courts say the 1st Amendment permits them to protest funerals, so be it. I just find attorneys who protest funerals in this manner as unfit to have a license. This is not what attorneys should be known for and it is not how we should act. Model Rules of Professional Conduct exist in every US state and I believe that if this firm doesn't violate the letter of the law, it certainly violates the spirit of it.**"

On this eve of the future."
607,AskReddit,"Since today World AIDS Day I thought it would those who feel alone and isolated if we talked about it. For those of us on Reddit who are HIV+, how did it happen to you? How did you cope? How is life for you at the moment?","I think it's only fair that I start, if I'm going to ask others to share things that may be personal.

I'm male, 27 and have had HIV for 5 years. When I was 22, I moved out from San Diego to Kansas City to be with my boyfriend of 3 years. He just had heart surgery (he is only a year older than I am, it was due to a faulty valve) and wanted to move back home to Kansas City. I followed him and a month later he dumped me. 

I was stranded out here financially and trusted people I shouldn't have. After a couple quick failed relationships, I gave up on love and looked for lust (hey, it was still attention). I went online to find someone to play with, and we played bare, and that's all it took.

I didn't cope well. Most of my close friends backed away or abandoned me at the time. I stopped going to school, quit work, didn't pay the bills, and found myself on the streets. A friend took me in and told me to get my shit together, and I did.

Right now, I'm going to college full time, work in web design full time, been in a relationship for 4 years with someone who is HIV negative, and am taking life one day at a time.

Statistically, I'll die before my friends, but it has made me appreciate life a lot more and enjoy their company. It sucks, but I'm still alive, and that's what counts right? 

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me, went looking online for sex, got HIV. Have had it for 5 years.

EDIT: Couple of things since I've found similar questions being asked, and feel it's best to answer them here.

**What's life like with your HIV negative boyfriend?** It's fine. Small things have to be remembered. When playing with each other, we do things that are low risk. Oral (no swallowing) use condoms, jerk each other off. Those sorts of things. I'm a bottom so it is a very low risk, but low risk doesn't equal no risk. Other than that, when I get injured (I play rugby, and I rock climb) or hurt myself, I have to remind people not to get near my blood if they can avoid it. 

**Why is HIV more prevalent in the gay community?** Many reasons. Mostly that anal sex will usually tear part of the inner walls, causing blood. Those pipes weren't meant for that kind of abuse ultimately. That's why it's such high risk for bottoms. The vagina is a little more resilient, but it's still an exchange of fluids. Nothing is 100%, remember that.

**Why did you have sex without a condom?** Because I was caught up in the moment, didn't want to ruin it, and I'm an idiot.

**Why did I talk about this?** I don't look for sympathy in posting this. I've come to terms pretty easily. It was my fault and I deserve it. I'm doing this so others out there don't feel alone. Though we might have contracted HIV differently, most of us are dealing with the same things. It's good to let others know they're not alone.

EDIT 2: More things I missed

**How do you feel about people who make jokes about HIV/AIDS?** I have no right to complain honestly. I make jokes about it to make it easier, and I've used it to (jokingly) guilt trip someone into small things (""You can't just eat my yoghurt!"" ""But... I'm dying!"" ""God damn it! Fine, you can have it!""). I've also made jokes at the expense of others due to their plights so I'm not sure I have room to complain. Regardless, I've always had a sunny disposition about things so honestly I prefer humour over not talking about things. If you can make me laugh about what's trying to kill me, you must be an alright person. And yes, I laughed at the AIDS song in Team America (because that was a very good parody of RENT).

**Why were you getting tested so often?** Everyone should. If you're sexually active, it's the smartest thing to do. It protects you, and it protects those around you that you play with. I know it may seem a bit odd, but asking people for proof of their last test shouldn't be so damn hard in our society. Between offending someone for asking them for their resent STD test results, or getting HIV because you trusted someone, I'd pick the option that doesn't try to kill me. Get tested, and get the people you know to be tested. Awareness and education about these things are important. It shouldn't just be for the gay community.

**Why don't you fix your title?** I know, I know. I messed it up, and you can't edit titles. This is what I get for rushing the title to get to the body of the post. I've made a horrible mistake :(

LAST EDIT

**Why not do an AMA?** I wanted this to be more about everyone else, and an outlet for them to tell their stories, just in case they felt like no one else would listen to them, and the ability for people to read other's stories. Nothing about me is special. There are plenty of people who have HIV/AIDS, and have just as much if not more to say than I do. I don't feel there's really a demand for it, and since I have no scientific answer, but merely personal ones, I don't see how it would help others.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an overwhelming number of positive posts in this thread, and it makes me happy. I appreciate the sentiments. 

For those who just spout of the first hateful thing you can, I'd love to refute the things you say, but it simply isn't worth the time. I don't know you, and you don't know me. It seems it'll stay that way.

For those that shared their stories, I thank you. It isn't always easy, and I appreciate it. For those letting others know they're loved and not alone, thank you. And for those who generally wanted to know more and read this, thank you. You guys are good people.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sadly it's that time for me to pass out, so I won't be able to respond. I hope people keep up the discussion, and keep up the awareness. If this can keep even one person from having to go through the same thing, it was worth it already. Have fun, but be smart about it!"

On 2009 February, McAfee’s siteadvisor.com flagged one of my sites as “not safe” and anyone with McAfee virus scanner or toolbar is now told it has a virus and is blocked from visiting it (existing users have emailed me daily about this too).

What actually happened is they basically pulled links to all executable files on my hosting. They then run it via their virus scanner with heuristic scanning turned ON. What this basically means is that any file which McAfee scanner ""thinks"" is a virus is now flagged as one. Anyway, so they found a file on my domain and tagged it as virus called “Search threat library”. Their result is based on guesswork because it says on the page: “In our tests, this download contained programs **some people** would consider adware, spyware or other potentially unwanted programs.” Thank you, that’s not vague at all! Now the reason I know this file *cannot* be a virus is because I compiled it myself (with *Delphi*) and was not a public download either.

So, I wrote to them, their support told me they’ll re-scan my website. I waited patiently for weeks but the flag was not removed. Being a small webmaster, I said fuck it and I just deleted the file from my server this time (to a 404 page). Wrote to them again (this was few months ago). They did not even reply this time. I emailed them a few more times to finally get another canned reply that my site will be queued again for scanning. I patiently waited for weeks again but nothing happened. So now I am basically being punished for something I **never** did and a file which *doesn't even exist* on my server for the last six months. 

Then one day it suddenly hit me.. You see the thing is McAfee siteadvisor.com also sells these hacker-safe certificates to websites for $360 / year. With that in picture, this whole fucking thing just makes sense. This is just a ploy to sell those certificates. In internet-speak, this is how it works:

    * Find and flag random files as a generic virus (based on some guesswork scanning)
    * Flag the entire domain for hosting viruses and start blocking visitors to it.
    * Domain owner buys *hacker-safe* certificates for an inane $360/year to get site re-tested.
    * Profit!

My option now is to either buy their $360 hacker-safe badge or keep losing more business everyday.. I’m a small webmaster, even if they turn 10 people away daily, it hurts me bad :( I do not have the resources to hire a lawyer or send them legal notices either.

So, I can buy their stupid certificate but I have been **waiting patiently since 2009 February** to resolve this and being strong armed into buying their stupid certificate after all this time will be so fucking very unfair. So I'm posting here as my last ditch attempt. 

I'm desperate for ideas, Reddit. What are my options? Please help me.. 

**edit:** I can see this on the front page. woohoo! Hopefully someone from McAfee will see it now and reply. Also I don't mind if a blogger wants to contact me for more details to write about this little scam too. I've also emailed all details to *AHhHhh_shit* and he has also been a lot of help. My site has been listed on McAfee ever since 2009 Feb and finally i'm beginning to see some hope that someone will at least hear my case! Thank you again Reddit for being awesome. 

**edit 2:** the editors of two leading tech blogs  just contacted me for details last night (replying now). Also, a lot of people have replied (or PMed me) with their own sites and similar stories which only makes me happy that this is finally getting some attention. I wrote to McAfee again (as per turnipsoup's advise) but it will take two business days before we hear from them. I am amazed with the advice and help Reddit has offered me. I will definitely post an update too if something happens.

**edit 3:** my site is finally green again.. woohoo! reddit did it. Everyone who mailed/contacted McAfee on my behalf thank you! I have waited almost an year for this to happen and you guys did it in less than 2 days. I really can't thank you guys enough for your support. I'm feeling very happy and very proud to be a part of this awesome community. This proves that reddit &gt; mcafee.. actually reddit &gt; everything. and redditors are awesome!"

654,AskReddit,It's been 2 Years. The List of Real Life Cheat Codes needs an update.,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c7wby/ok_reddit_lets_make_itthe_list_of_real_life_cheat/) is the original post made by a redditor called Lurial about two years ago.

While those cheats may be awesome, it's about time we got some new ones up there and i'm sure there are more than 30 cheat codes we could all use. I've messaged [Bacongobbler](http://www.reddit.com/user/bacongobbler) - A redditor who makes AmA's into comprehensive, easy to read and straightforward lists about doing the same with the cheat codes so they're easier to read. 

That's about it, I'll start us off:

1. When you go to a restaurant where they bring you your drink in a cup/glass, ask for no ice or for ice on the side. Often what they do is load your drink with ice so that it seems as if there's more in there, especially at bars.

2. When you pour soda, pour it along the side of the cup instead of directly into it - like they do at bars. This keeps alot of the ""fizzyness"" in the drink and as a result, it keeps a lot of the texture and flavor.

3. If you need to withdraw more money than your limit, if you do it quickly enough, you can withdraw your limit twice from the same ATM and sometimes the one next to it before it stops you from withdrawing any more.

Thanks for your submissions!

**EDIT:** Woah! Front page! Bacongobbler replied and said he'd be able to make the list sometime today.

Thanks Again Everyone, these are some awesome cheat codes :D

**EDIT 2:** Bacongobbler's put up his easy-to-read version of this post [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uou6z/update_i_was_requested_to_compile_all_of_the/)."

675,AskReddit,"I was once so constipated that the doctor had to manually assist me with the turd birth. Reddit, what are some of your most embarrassing medical stories?","It was six years ago when I was eighteen. I had been in my first year of college so needless to say my student diet wasn't that great. My boyfriend and I were house sitting for a friend and on the third night there I was awoken to the most terrible stabbing pain in my stomach. I tried to get to the bathroom but I ended up collapsing on the floor in a near fetal position, barely able to breathe and sweating profusely. My boyfriend hears me fall and gets up to see what is wrong. I can't speak, the pain is so great and I am having a hard time breathing so he painstakingly leads me to our friends car and drives me to the hospital. 

At this point I'm in so much pain from him not really knowing how to drive a stick and jerking and stalling along the way that he has to go in and ask for assistance. I'm loaded onto a gurney and strapped in because the outstretched position nearly kills me with pain and I start lashing out. After the doctor cuts off my clothes and sees no outward injuries on my stomach, he begins to compress on my stomach which nearly makes me pass out. He thinks my appendix must have burst, or that I had a ruptured intestine. I'm administered IV Morphine and finally get some relief. 

They roll me down the hall and take some instagrams of my stomach. To get the X-rays back takes a while, so while we were all awaiting the pics I was administered more morphine. Eventually, a big woman with a Texas accent enters the room and exclaims, ""You're full of shit!""

""What?"" I ask, completely confused and holding my stomach. ""I'm serious. I'm in a lot of pain.""

""Oh, no doubt,"" she said, and pulls out an X-ray of my stomach. ""See all that white in your guts?"" She points with her pen and traces all the way from my anus up through my large intestines. ""You are LITERALLY full of shit. I have never seen someone so full of shit in my life.""

My boyfriend erupts in laughter and the nurse is trying her best to hide her amusement as she has been tending me through the hours and knows that I am obviously in a lot of pain. I groan but am a bit amused myself. It WAS pretty funny, after all. I ask the doctor what they were going to do about it and she said that they were going to do an enema and see how that went. I was given laxatives and a ton of water and told to wait 20 minutes. I can feel my stomach rumbling a bit at this point and it hurts me a lot when it does. 

Eventually a nurse wheels in what looks like a dominatrix sex rack, complete with ankle and wrist straps. My boyfriend again erupts into a fit of laughter. I am not amused this time. I'm starting to get a bit embarrassed so before we begin I ask that he leave. He pretty much begs me to let him stay but I'm having none of it. After he leaves the nurse wheels in what looks to be some sort of futuristic pressure washer; I'm pretty much right. 

She straps my ankles and wrists to the rack in an upright position and proceeds to insert the tube into my ass. It's uncomfortable and cold, but hey, I'm gay so it's like.. whatever. She then turns it on, and like the first mate on the Titanic begins to slowly increase power and pressure. I can feel and SEE my stomach begin to inflate slightly and OH MERCY does it hurt like nothing else. It felt like knives were pushing OUT of me now, ever so slowly. I cry out but she insists ***MORE POWER*** and I keep filling up like a balloon, hollering in agony. After a minute or so of constant pressure she turns it off and tells me to clench up because she was removing the tube. I want nothing more than to do just the opposite, but I assume she knows what she's doing and follow orders. She then attached another tube to a hose and inserts it. This one is MUCH bigger and the lube is cold as fuck, but I'm gay so it's still whatever. 

She then proceeds to Hoover my mother fucking insides. After 30 seconds I hear a ""hmmm"". I ask her what the problem was and she told me nothing was coming out but I beg her not to pressure wash my guts again. At this time the doc comes in as she's pulling out my butt plug and informs me that the shit packed in my colon is too wide in girth to be machine enema'd out. She was going to have to do this manually. 

She has the nurse grab a bucket, a plain white janitors bucket and puts it underneath me. She then puts on the latex gloves, completely lubes up her hands and begins what I consider to be some sort of medical fingerbang to loosen me up. After a while of this (I was trying to keep my mind focused on something other than this butch P.E. teacher-lookin' southern woman giving me assplay legally so I wasn't keeping track of time) she brings out a stretching device and begins to open me with it. At this point I feel so ashamed of myself, but I'm also doped out of my mind. The pain begins to come back in full force and I start shouting for more painkillers but Lady McGuyver down there tells me that they can't administer more because it will stop me up even more. I'm just going to have to deal with it until they can ""unclog me"". So, I endure as I'm being stretched. It hurts like hell down on my asshole, too. I feel her fingers in there and she tells me to push. So, I push. I push so hard that I feel like the blood vessels in my face are popping. My head starts to bang. I'm pushing hard and she's telling me to push more. I must have been screaming my head off. I can't imagine that I wasn't. Finally, I felt something give. She told me to push more and I did I could feel things moving. So, I push some more. After a minute I finally feel myself deflating as water and shit debris tumble out into the bucket. It all happened very quick after that. I was unobstructed and gushing hot lava a minute later and finally felt complete, utter, blissful relief. 

I was told after I woke up in the hospital 8 hours later, around 5 PM, that the doc literally helped deliver my shit child. I had never been more embarrassed in my life. But, as time passes, and my humor ""evolves"", I find myself laughing about it. I changed my diet immediately after and have a good healthy bowel movement at least once a day. I found it strange how my depression lifted a lot after that. I had been severely depressed for a couple of weeks before that and I found out that being constipated does that. 

So, your turn!

**TL;DR** Got severely constipated so much that I had to go to the ER, where enemas and laxatives didn't work. A woman doctor had to crank my asshole open and help me deliver a shit baby with her hands.

685,AskReddit,What are your relationship hacks? I'll start it off . . .,"Relationship hacks:

1) When she's not around, go check the labels on her shoes, shirts, pants, bra, and underwear. Measure one of her necklaces to see what length she likes. Pocket one of her rings, take it to a jeweler and have them tell you what size it is. Write all of these sizes down.

2) At some point she will ask you to buy tampons for her. It happens. When you go to the store, buy 3 small packages of her brand. Give her one and hide the other two in your car (near the spare tire, she'll never look there). Next time she asks you to buy her some you can just go to the bar and have a beer instead of actually going to the store.

3) Never buy a diamond. Cubic zirconia and moissanite look just as good, and man-made diamonds are getting easier to find every year.

Edit: To clarify #3, there doesn't need to be any deception. It's just stupid to pay $1500 for a worthless rock. Go buy a $300 ring, propose, if she says yes then tell her that you bought a ring with a synthetic stone because you don't enjoy funding civil wars. If you still feel the obligation to verify your love with a poor financial decision, give her a $1200 gift certificate to a bridal store.

Edit2: I thought of another one:  
4) If your SO likes to spoon, but you're not in the mood to cuddle with a thermonuclear device, just follow wreckemtech's handy MS Paint guide to [Faux Spooning](http://imgur.com/2ePio.png). If you're still too hot, stick your free foot out of the covers.

692,AskReddit,"Corporate Whistleblower, should I do it?","The organization I work for is one of the largest employers in the country, their annual profits (public information) could fund a small country, or purchase half of Africa, for obvious reasons that is all I'm going to say to indicate the scale of this matter.

A few months ago, a form circulated through nearly every major department. We were given no explanation on what this form was for, even when asking managers etc. Their responses were always vague and something along the lines of ""it's for training purposes.""

I tried to politely decline filling out one of these forms which required all kinds of personal information but was told in no uncertain terms ""I had to"" - now I know in a perfect world I would have stuck it to the man, but I have rent to pay and I get dizzy if I don't eat at least twice every 24 hours. First world problems!

Today, the reason we were ""forced"" to sign this form became apparent (to me at least) - a small group of employees from my department were invited into a room to complete the aforementioned ""training.""

Now this training was supposed to have taken place over a period of months - which they illegally back dated all the paper work to reflect. A facilitator was supposed to monitor and observe our competencies and have us complete a number of practical tasks as well as fill out some written short answer questions, multiple choice, standard stuff.

Instead, they had us fraudulently complete the assessments by feeding us the answers, filling in all the sections with competent where the trainer should have, place back dates and numerous other fallacies all over this thing, and then sign, date it and hand it back like it was nothing to worry about.

Here is the kicker, for every hour spent by this imaginary facilitator over the imaginary period of imaginary months, observing us and training us to be competent in this particular area, they are receiving government funding, subsidization and kick backs. 

Now don't get me wrong I know it's pretty commonplace for corporations to make their training ""fool proof"" pad it out and do some spoon feeding. But straight up lying and then making your employees a party to it, all under the guise of something very vague in an environment where major line managers are there and it's unbelievably uncomfortable to be the guy who says ""Hey, something is not right here"" - which I did at stage 1 on multiple occasions only to be shot down is not something anyone should have to endure in a professional environment.

I'm kind of at a loss as to what I should do, am I over reacting and being an asshat about this? I consider myself to be a more or less good person, I value morals, you can sugar coat it and say who cares or whatever but at the end of the day, this is pure and simple.

A massive corporation fraudulently acquiring government kickbacks, which taxpayers then have to foot the bill for, when said company already makes squillions more than necessary for any one to be happy with. I feel like I've been made an accessory to some greedy low act and I am not happy about it.

I don't know whether to try and ask someone about it, I have a feeling that would go badly. I could try to deal with it internally, I also have a feeling that would go very badly, and know from experience that it has for others in the past. Or I could go to an independent watchdog type organization and become a full on whistleblower....

Conflicted, help me reddit, what do? This is not sitting right with me at all.


PS.

Did some very approximate number crunching based on the limited information that I do have for sure, if they did this with all the staff in my department alone which is a small fragment of the total organization, they would stand to gain in excess of $1.7million in tax payer funds.

Multiply that out across the entire organization, I cringe at the very idea of what that final number would be."

716,AskReddit,"Reddit, my wife's dad was on the Ed Sullivan show in 1969, but he has no recording. I'm told it's probably impossible to find. Can you help me find it for his birthday?","**9/27/2010 - my follow-up is stuck in spam on both reddit.com and askreddit** :/
**9/28/2010 - okay, follow-up [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/djt6n/thank_you_reddit_you_made_my_fatherinlaws/)

He was in the Georgia Tech Glee Club, and they were the musical guest on the show. I don't think he's even seen the episode since the original airing in 1969.

I've tried torrents, every video site I know of, CBS.com, Amazon, and I've even tried contacting our local CBS affiliate.

I'm about ready to give up, but I've seen Reddit do amazing things. Maybe someone's great-grandfather was a producer for the show. Maybe someone here has every episode of every talk show ever made pressed into gold-plated LP records for purposes of first-contact with aliens.

I'm not optimistic as I've read that Johnny Carson's Tonight Show has no surviving footage from prior to 1970 (apparently shows used to recycle tape as it was expensive). I fear the same will be true for all but the most famous moments of the Ed Sullivan Show.

Failing that, maybe someone has an awesomely appropriate idea for what might be the next best thing if the video itself is impossible.

Here's the IMDb entry for the episode - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0724932/

tl;dr - (see the title)

**edit**: I guess it's probably not possible. Thanks to those of you who commented.

**edit 2**: Well, something changed. For about 15 minutes, this post was showing no upvotes; it wasn't even registering my attempts to upvote those who had commented. Then a flood of them came in. I guess I was glitched somehow. Hope reigns!

**EDIT!  WE MAY HAVE FOUND IT!!**

Current situation as of 5:15pm

I just got an email from someone reliable who says that they have a copy of this episode and can send it to me! I'm very optimistic that this is legit, but I don't have it in my hands yet.

More to come later on! Thanks again to all of you. I'm looking forward to recapping this to give credit where credit is due and to share some more detail about the cool stuff that came up during this process.

Wooooooo!!!!!!

***keeping this stuff below because it's interesting for those just finding this and because it's not 100% a sure thing yet***

* It would be good if I could know for sure whether or not CBS has a recording somewhere in their archives.

* Even more people saying there's a chance they have/know of a copy.

* Yes, I have successfully spoken with The Paley Center. They do not have the episode and have referred me to SOFA.

* SOFA Entertainment had been brought up before, but I'm convinced now that I'll need to go to them unless one of those back channels comes through somehow. No official organization (CBS, museums, archives, universities, websites, etc.) will give me a copy of the video without SOFA's permission. I've heard this from multiple credible sources now.  I've also been told that they have been rigidly protective of their materials on occasion in the past, but that they are sometimes accommodating. I'm hoping for the latter.

* I have made an inquiry and am awaiting response.

* A few Redditors have said that they may have a back-route to getting a copy through various friends or connections. These leads are very cool and would be typical Reddit magic if one of them comes through.

* A couple of Redditors have provided me with contact info for people at SOFA--one of them had info from a previous successful effort to get a copy of a clip. I have an email in to SOFA now.

* I've gotten helpful responses from a handful of people at various websites and organizations. I'll thank them later when this is all done with.

* A PBS station did some rebroadcasts of Sullivan's shows. I can try to contact WQED to see if they have any of that footage. Someone below said a friend works there, so that's potentially a promising lead.

* Georgia Tech's archives library has responded with a negative. I have emails oustanding with a few others at Georgia Tech who may be in a unique position to know of an unofficial recording somewhere.

So I either have to go through Sofa or hope for Reddit magic. This might be the last update for a few hours until I can get back to this. (EDIT: Reddit magic it is!)"

718,AskReddit,"Can you one-up me in ""most offensive joke you know""?","I'd like to hear your worst. Heres my candidate: 

Mike gets a call at work he had been waiting for. The baby is coming and the wifes already at the hospital! He hightails it from work gets there as fast as he can, and paces in the waiting room. A few minutes pass and a doctor comes out and asks ""Are you mr Smith?""

""Yes yes whats the news?""

""you need to see this, its unbelievable but, **YOUR CHILD CAN FLY**

Mike follows him into the nursery with a ""Is this guy retarded"" face.

The doctor walks right up to the newborn in the crib and picks him up slightly and then lets go. The baby lands softly on his back.

""Hmm weird he just did it a second ago"" So the doctor picks the baby up out of the crib and lets go. The baby hits the ground with a sickening thud.

By now Mike is furious. 

""**NO IM SERIOUS HE JUST DID IT A SECOND AGO SEE LOOK**""

And what that, the doctor opens up the window on the fifth floor nursery and slings the baby out the window. The baby boomerangs right into a parked car, shattering the windshield, glass and guts go spraying everywhere.

Just as Mike reaches his arm back to punch the everliving **FUCK** out of the doctor he says 

""Nah man im just messin with ya. It was a stillborn""

721,AskReddit,*Modpost* - Personal Information and You: Why Zero Tolerance Keeps us all Safer.,"Dear lovely AskReddit users,

It's been a little while since our last mod post and that's a testament to how brilliant you guys have been. However, recently we've had an increase in breaking of our most important rule - no personal information. I'll try to keep this short because most of you are brilliant but I just need to cover **why** it's our (and reddit as a whole's) most important rule:

1) Once personal, identifying information is out there, it's out there forever.

2) The potential consequences for the person whose personal information it is are on a completely different level to anything else that could go wrong on reddit.

3) Users and non-users alike have a **right** to their own personal information being protected. Would you want your name and phone number posted for millions of people you don't know to see?

4) In any group big enough, there are going to be people who take things too far or have a different conscience to you. There's a very real possibility that someone sees the information and takes it to a level that you would think abhorrent.

And most importantly

5) Stories on reddit have a life of their own. How many times have we seen someone post a small story that blew up and either ended up being a lie/wrong/one-side of the argument etc? **We have no way of knowing if the story we're hearing is true or not**. When it's a question of whether to upvote someone's questionable story, that's not a huge deal. When it comes to someone having their address posted all over the internet with allegations of a serious crime, it's completely different. 

We had a post get very popular today where a user was claiming that his phone was stolen by a TSA agent and posted (what he claimed to be) the satellite location of his phone. Let's think this through:

* We have no way of knowing if the user lied to get back at someone/cause drama/for a joke etc.

* We have no way of knowing if the user was simply mistaken

* We have no way of knowing if the address is accurate

* We have no way of knowing what would happen if someone tried to be a hero and go over there

* We have no idea  if the user is scamming other redditors

**Personal information takes internet fun and adds very real, real life consequences, often to innocent people**.

**If you see any personal information (address, full names, phone numbers - any attempt to personally identify someone) contact the mods immediately and we will ban those posting it, no questions asked.**

FAQs

1) Does this include famous people/public figures/companies/groups etc?

This really depends on what the information is and what the context is. Is there an expectation of privacy? Is the information being used for malicious reasons? If you're desperate to post something and you think it *may* be personal information, simply **message the mods** and ask us. You won't get banned for asking.

2) What about photos?

You are allowed to post photos of yourself (although we always recommend that you don't show your face). The only reason we will ban/remove for a photo is if that photo contains identifiable information in it.

3) Can I post my own information?

We have no way of knowing whether it genuinely is your information or someone else's and it would be impractical to act as the detectives for 2.5 million users. 

4) What about X subreddit?

I'm just a mod for askreddit, I don't have control over other subreddits. However, if the mods of that subreddit have been non-responsive to PI issues, please message the admins. They take it **very** seriously.

**Important note**: There's a difference between mods and admins. Admins run the entire website and get paid to do so. Mods run specific subreddits and have no power outside of their subreddits. I can't do anything to SRS."

723,AskReddit,Whats the wierdest scenario you have ever woken up to after drinking?,"One night, I came home from a party. For some reason, I get really hungry when Im drunk, so I decided to make myself some food. I found a frozen pizza and put it in the oven, on top of a some newspaper to avoid messing up the oven. It seemed pretty logic at that point. I turned around, slicing up some bacon to put on the frozen pizza. I cut myself pretty badly while doing this, but i dont notice. I hear a sound, so i turn around. Its the paper in the oven, its burning. This is all i can remember. 

I wake up to my mom shouting. Im on the floor of my kitchen. Around me is what looks like some sort of satanic food-ritual. There is ashes and blood in  a circle around me. I had seemingly tried to put out the burning paper with my bleeding hands. Bacon and a pretty messed up, halfway-done frozen pizza is formed to some sort of a matress under me, and for some reason, my pants are halfway down my legs."

752,AskReddit,"Do you realize that when you belittle people for asking ""stupid"" questions, you destroy their ability to keep asking questions?","I have posted the gist of this before as a comment, but given my late arrival to the very popular thread about people asking stupid questions and the importance of this issue, I think it deserves a thread in and of itself.

I hate threads that ask about stupid, ignorant questions other people ask. They are belittling and low. Self-congratulatory assholes who snicker and roll their eyes at these people are the reason people stop asking questions: because you make them feel stupid. They're trying to learn something, and you're shitting all over them because you come into the situation with the benefit of having greater prior knowledge than them, or the benefit of a mind better at rational examination.

I'm going to have to paraphrase Carl Sagan here, because I don't know exactly where my copy of The Demon-Haunted World is, but here goes:

&gt; There is no such thing as a stupid question. Many people say that, but it really is true. Every question, no matter how ill-formed or ignorant of knowledge, is a request for knowledge, a request for information. It is an effort to understand better. Every time someone asks an honest question, it is an interrogation of nature, an attempt to unlock the secrets of the universe.

Now we're back to me. You assholes are the dicks who drive people away from science. You're the people who consign them to never understanding, because they're afraid of being made fun of for asking the questions they need to ask in order to understand...because when they did try, you laughed at them and made them feel stupid for trying to understand. Nobody wants to feel stupid, and ""better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and remove all doubt."" Many of us condemn the jock and cheerleader stereotypes that made it uncool to enjoy or be good at science or school in general, but you dicks who laugh at the ignorant people are no better.

So go ahead and complain about how stupid your peers are. Weep for your generation or engage in further hyperbolic hyperventilation about how fucked everything is because some of us are dumber. In a very real way, when you laugh at these people and when you masturbate your own intellectual egos over the stupidity of people not so fortunate as you, you make it all worse. 

You are the bane of education. You are the killer of dreams. Someone, at a critical juncture, makes a decision to try to understand and they get _laughed at_. Humiliated. Shamed. All for ... what? Having the audacity to want to understand, or offer a suggestion that seems reasonable to their limited understanding?

Now, of course I am not talking about the class clowns or assholes asking questions to be funny or to be dicks. But any _honestly-asked_ question is what I'm talking about, no matter how silly or ""stupid."" And sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.

Instead of laughing at these people and letting them go through their life unvalidated and their thirst for information suppressed, why don't you recognize that they have a fundamental deficiency of knowledge and that the teacher may not have the ability or inclination to help them fill it. Then _help them yourself_. Just the tiniest bit of validation, even later, can mitigate the embarrassment that he or she feels, and just might result in one less person you would later consider a mindless drone.

tl;dr: Quit being assholes. Don't belittle people who ask a question you think is ignorant and consign them to more ignorance."

761,AskReddit,What are somethings that people pay for that can be acquired for free or low cost.,"Don't say sex, just don't.

Edit: Holy moly front page! hells yeah! 

Most common answer: Water, definitely not free but low cost, yes. People stop paying for ridiculously expensive plastic water bottles and pooping on the environment. Get a refillable water bottle and any sort of filter (tap filters, filter jugs, bottle w/ filter) and boom instant karma (not the reddit kind the other one)! 

Top answer: I said no sex, so you said porn? really sneeky redditors, good job! 

Have an awesome Thursday everyone! "
762,AskReddit,"Today i crapped myself on my way to work...
Whats is the most horrific thing you have done in public? ","Today i overslept, waking up in a rush, dressed an ran out to catch the bus. Entering the bus I feel a wierd cold feeling in my stomach. When to bus enters the station I need to take a crap so hard and i am sweating like a pig. Running in to a cafe asking for a toilet the owners directs me to a public toilet in the square. When i have 5 meters left the pain is to horrific and my body gives up, and boom goes the dynamite, half crapped my pants opening the door to the toilet and guess what... It was an urinal. I lean against it and lets my body breathe, It was the biggest crap I have taken in my life, looked like a cow had been there when I was finished (feeling bad for the cleaners). Then i went out to find a McDonalds and there i took my undies off threw in the trash, wiped, called in sick at work and took a cab home.

I am 22 years old and cant even remember soiling myself as a kid...

**Edit** - Feels alot better now knowing I'm not alone... and frontpage because i shit myself

**Edit 2** - For those who asks how you not can feel earlier when you have to shit, I was getting on the bus and it's a no stop ride for 20 minutes, it attacked me from nowhere after 2 minutes and when i got off the bus i ran around looking for a toilet for 5 minutes and the rest you know.. I had no chance

**Edit 3** - For those who is asking, I am a guy. (And thanks for all the poo stories:))

765,AskReddit,What's the best prank you've ever heard of/seen/experienced?,"I'll start... I had a friend that spent his summers on research trips in Antarctica every year for 10 or so years. One year, on a hike with colleagues, he was deep in a rocky valley having lunch when someone gasped and pointed, speechless, high above them. As they all turned and squinted up towards the peak on one side of the valley, the silhouette of a tall, but lanky looking tree became clear. 

The group (8 men) went absolutely silent as they all stared. The tree was evidently alive and well, the hue around the tree indicated that it was still green. All of the men digested the sight before leaping up, dropping lunch, coffee - everything - to the ground. Of course this is the biggest breakthrough EVER. There are NO trees on Antarctica, in fact, chances are the last tree to grow on Antarctica was 240-300 million years ago. Every last one of the men (including my friend) agreed to abandon the task at hand and make it a priority to climb the peak, identify the tree, name the likely new species after one of them - or a fancy acronym of all of their names and make goddam history. 

It took 4 hours to climb about 1/3 of the way up. At this point the crumbly face of the peak made it difficult and only four men proceeded with what picks and ropes they had for safe ascent. Luckily, Antarctica in the summer means constant daylight. It took near 13 hours to reach the tree. My friend was one of the four to make the final climb - he described it as one of the hardest of his life (he was a hiker but not much of a climber). He said that on the way up, two others argued (when breath allowed), the guy who spotted the tree had decided that its discovery should be attributed to him - he was passionate about his cause and pretty much turned into an angry man that the other guys didn't even recognise. 

Once they reached the tree, they realised that they had in fact made history. My friend laughed so hard he swore he wet himself a little, as he plonked down at the top of this peak, he wondered, what kind of motherfucker brings an 8 foot plastic tree to Antarctica and what kind of motherfucker climbs 13 hours with an 8 foot plastic tree just to plant it, a good day or twos hike from the nearest hint of civilisation. Whoever it was, he swears it was the funniest damn prank he'd ever fallen for and to this day calls respect on that pranksters dedication.

**td;dr**   Friend in Antarctica is part of group who discovers first tree in Antarctica in several hundred million years. Climbs 13 hours to investigate, discovers tree is plastic and they've just fallen for the most epic but successful prank ever. 

**Update** Holy awesome day!! I've just spent the entire day reading brilliant pranks. Thanks for all the posts and upvotes! I intended to post my favs but honestly, there are so many I don't even know anymore.

766,AskReddit,What inanimate object has it out for you?,I wanna hear about it.
768,AskReddit,"[Serious] Male victims of sexual assault, harassment, or rape, to clear some common misconceptions, what were your experiences like?","Sexual crimes against males are often taken less seriously than their counterpart, I would like to hear some serious discussion about what the other side of the coin is really like."
769,AskReddit,Unmuffled motorcycle owners: why do you think it is OK to ride through a town/city cranking out 100+ decibels?,"As far as I'm concerned, unmuffled motorcycles are a menace to civilized society and should be completely banned. I'm sure someone disagrees...but why?

To save some time: the ""freedom"" argument is a non-starter, we obviously have many laws to protect the peace and quiet, even in large cities. (I would counter with the ""what if everyone did it?"" argument, and the answer is that cities would be unlivable, full stop).

Also, don't say ""construction noise is just as loud""...that is a necessary evil to build infrastructure, just like ambulance sirens are a necessary evil. Joyriding on a motorcycle isn't necessary in the first place, much less on a super-loud banshee from hell.  

**Edit:** 

First, to be clear, I'm not against motorcycles, just really loud ones.

So far, the top reasons seem to be:

1) Loud pipes save lives

2) Fuck you, that's why

Also, reason 1 appears to be very debatable. As does my sexual orientation, which is weird since I wasn't really asking about that.


**Edit 2:** 

What an amazing response, I love Reddit! Adding to the above, the other reason that pops up is:

3) Performance improves without muffler/baffles

I kind of took this as a given, since this is true of cars, too, though and almost all cars have mufflers on them. And, for those who are asking, I don't have it out for motorcycles, this same question applies to any vehicle that drives through a populated area. In my personal experience, more motorcycles than cars have that ear-splitting, building-shaking kind of engine noise."
770,AskReddit,I just found out my HIV test was a false positive. What's the best news you've ever gotten?,"Background: I am an ex-drug addict (clean from heroin and cocaine for 3.5 months!) Lately, I'd been getting sick pretty often and feeling incredibly tired. I'd also been suffering low-grade fevers and infections that wouldn't go away. To rule out one explanation, I opted to get an HIV test. 

Last Friday, the ELISA came back positive. I was stunned but recovered pretty quickly. Over the past few days, I've been adjusting to the idea of life with a chronic disease. I wasn't optimistic about it being a false positive because of my symptoms and the reported accuracy of the ELISA test. I had kind of surrendered to the idea. 

However, this morning  I had a voicemail on my phone from my doctor. She told me the confirmatory test results were in -- another ELISA and western blot came back negative! I got blood drawn yesterday which will undergo a thorough battery of tests. Hopefully they're all negative too, but at the very least I don't have HIV.

I'm saving this voicemail forever. When I'm feeling disgruntled or ungrateful, it will serve as a reminder of how much worse things could be.

775,AskReddit,"When I was 7, I called 911 on my friend's mom who was beating my friend bloody with a switch. What did you get in massive trouble for as a child, only to commend yourself for as an adult?","Full story: My parent's worked full time so I stayed with a neighbor after school until they got home. My neighbor had two daughters: 6 and 10 at the time. The 6 year old was my best friend and we played in her front yard mostly because her mother hated noise in the house. One day it was raining so we were playing upstairs. I guess we were too loud, because the mother had the girl go out back and pull a switch from a bush. I came into the kitchen to my friend bent over a chair, getting wailed on with a branch - bloody marks down her back and legs.  Our parents never hit us as kids, so I freaked. I went back upstairs and called 911, as you're told to do in an emergency when you're 7. I told the operator what was happening and he sent a squad car out. Child services visited the house regularly after that. I was never allowed over to play again, and my parents were pissed about having to dip into savings for an after school babysitter.  20 years later, I'm fucking proud of myself for trying to stop a violent attack on a six year old. 

Edit: Wow, thanks to everyone for your stories.  I'm reading through as many as I can, and it's devastating to hear about what some of you went through as kids.  I just called my mom for her input on this story, and she said after I explained the severity of the abuse that they were proud of me for calling the authorities. She said she made an anonymous call to child protective services the next day as a follow up.  My parents would never place babysitter money over a child's safety, and I'm glad to have her part of the story now too.  Thanks again everyone."

10:15pm MST  Title says it all. I GeoIP'ed the ip address and it is somewhere in Denver which is an hour or two away from my house. Ideas? I've never wanted to hit the front page more in my entire life.

10:45pm MST    Update 1: Keylogger installed.

11:10pm MST     Update 2: Computer has been turned off, I hope he turns it back on. I wonder if the Wake-on-LAN feature is enabled?

12:15am MST    Update 3: Señor PoopFace appears to have disabled the keylogger. We are having power outages and this might be the culprit but I am still incredibly suspicious. 

1:07am MST    Update 4: Señor PoopFace did not uninstall the logger.

1:27am MST    Update 5: I have retrieved what appear to be SENORITA PoopFace's myspace credentials. Will report back shortly.

Question: What time do you think is guaranteed they will be asleep. I demand to know within a 95% confidence interval.

2:46am MST Update 6: I took over the computer only to find someone watching Lion King in iTunes at almost 3am. I was quick to black the screen but who knows what they saw of me clicking around. I was able to get the log file that never sent out. Must inspect and find it's secrets. Also stuck Prey on there so I can see when it is safe to take over the computer.


Whoever is using the computer loves internet Backgammon and sucks at Hearts.

3:31am MST Update 7: From what I can tell from the logger, their internet connection is terrible which would explain why the log data never came to my email. I'm all sleuthed out and I'm exhausted. Will post more exciting business tomorrow. Thanks a million everyone. Couldn't have done it without the hivemind!



12:17am (next day) MST update 8: waited for the computer to be inactive for a few hours and then went to work. Router login credentials were admin admin. Awesome. Found SSID and Router MAC. SSID appears to contain their house number, but not street name. I draw ever closer.

Big, stinky update    3:24 pm (next day) MST update 9:  Pipl.com gave an address corresponding with the name from myspace. Going to go cruise by the house and check for the SSID. Will report back soon!

disappointment update     4:45 pm (next day) update 10: Drove by Pipl.com address result. Super super sketchy neighborhood. The house was at the end of a dead end so it looked suspicious enough us driving through there. All the neighbors are out doing hoodrat stuff in street. We made 2 passes and didn't get a hit on the SSID and had to give up before we blew our cover. Called the police department to find out that there are not any detectives in the city that work on the weekends. I was instructed to sit on it until Monday. Dumb.


wardrive update     10:45 pm (day 2) update 11: Have my Alfa awus036h configured with Netstumbler on a laptop. Going in for a night mission and hoping for better results. I borrowed a beater of a car to be a little less conspicuous in the hood. I have high hopes for this mission. If this SSID matches what I have from before, I have an address to give the police.


wardrive #3 update BIG NEWS 6:34 PM (day 3) update 12: I've been outside their house. I know where they live. I will claim what is MINE.



7:23 PM (day 3) update 13: Officer just came to my house and I gave him absolutely everything they could possibly need to know. Times, IP addresses, MAC addresses, SSID, street address, names, phone numbers, ages, DOBs, schools attended, name of homeowner, etc. If this falls apart, someone will be receiving the bitchslap of vengeance and it won't be me.[WAR CAR!](http://imgur.com/4dx7v.jpg)


5:15 PM (day 4) update 14: I am fucking pissed. I left a message this morning for the ONE detective responsible for cyber-crime (read: he's the only one that knows how to turn on a computer). He has yet to call me back. Insanely frustrated at this point. I handed them everything on a silver platter. My best guess is they have a backlog of stuff from the weekends. Because they don't do detective work on the weekends. Wonderful. Calling in favors from family friends tonight. I really wish would be resolved by counting on the police department. Will report back tomorrow.

3:00 AM (day 5) update 16: These turds have changed the background of my computer to a picture of them snuggling and kissing each other. They're using my two 1920x1200 monitors and the picture can't be more than 300x300. Of course, the picture is tiled and pasted on the desktop like 30 times. You know that shit I'm talking about. From the log file, I saw that they opened up My Pictures, looked at some of them, and then started deleting them. One at a time. It took them more than 45 minutes. I don't know if they deleted all of them, and I'm sure I can recover them (they're probably still just sitting the the recycle bin) but their intentions were clear. My blood boils. 

11:00 AM (day 5) update 15: I am no longer pissed. I got a hold of the detective assigned to the case this morning. He is super legit. He had only been handed the case late last evening and hadn't had a chance to look over it. I was able to explain it to him from start to finish over the phone. He sounds like a super nice guy but I still have to document the steps I've taken. He asked me to write up the process in technical and layman's terms in order to prove that I'm competent in this field so if he has to bring it before a judge, my info can be used.


Funny update 6:30 PM (day 5) update 16: I think I just figured out why their internet is terrible. The entire time, my uTorrent has been seeding and choking the shit out of their connection. I have like 40 torrents seeding, and I only have it capped at like 800 KB/s upload. I need to turn it off ASAP.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

I wasn't aware that people were checking back often for updates, so here is some of the ridiculous stuff that has happened on my computer.

*They open up iTunes and were sorely disappointed when their search returned no results for 'michal jacsin'

*They don't know what Firefox and Chrome do. I have no idea how they even found Internet Explorer on my computer but they did.

*I just realized my torrents are absolutely choking their internet connection to death

**TL;DR**  I have obtained names and myspace credentials, phone number, and street address for the (suspected) thieves.

**TIL**  Everyone should install LogMeIn and Prey on all of their computers. There is a good possibility they will be responsible for having my computer returned.

**important question** Does anyone know how to search for a house(s) using only the house number and the city, not the street name. Reverse whitepages yielded nothing. **answer** used a few links below and searched every zip code in my city.  No results so  probably  not  an address. 

**question #2** What firmware do you load on a WRT54G in order to wardrive? My first attempt was a failure because I was just using my android phone and a laptop to try to snag the wifi signal. **answer** Laptop with a USB wireless adapter duct taped to the top of my car seemed to work well. Hell yes Wifi Stumbler. **[What a clean install](http://imgur.com/4dx7v.jpg)**

**question #3** I can't find any legit (or otherwise) keylogger software! There's only 3 days left on the one on there now and then the gig is up. Anybody have a good keylogger that can stealth AND email out the logs?"

I delivered a pizza to this fellow and his family almost every week for two years. They all seemed so happy, him, his wife, his kids.

The second to last delivery was weird, he ordered a plain pizza (unlike his normal half pepperoni and half black olives). the garage was open as it normally was and his kids greeted me at the door by name.

794,AskReddit,How have you traumatized your parents?,"Here's my story. 

It begins far away from my parents, deep in the woods. 

I was 18 years old. As summer came to a close, I went on a weeklong hiking trip with my girlfriend. We went off the grid, many miles from civilization. There were no designated campsites, running water, etc. We were roughing it. 

Being young and randy, we wanted to have our share of sexytimes, so I brought a sizable stash of condoms. Of course, there were no garbage cans in the middle of the woods. When the deed was done, I had to put the used condoms into a ziplock baggie in my backpack. By the end of our week in the sweltering August sun, that baggie was full and funky.

The trip went well. I returned to my parents' house exactly one day before I had to leave for my sophomore year of college. I was a ridiculous slob. So, using my patented packing style, I hastily dumped my backpack's contents into my bedroom closet, picked through the mess, took what I needed and left the rest.

Yeah. I forgot about the baggie.

But somebody else found it. No, not my parents. My dog.

Basically, my parents came home one day to find used condoms spread all over the living room. Yeah. 

Apparently, my dog had found the baggie, but he didn't just sniff it, or eat it on the spot or whatever. No, he took it downstairs and spread my week-old rubbers and spooge all over the couch and carpet in the living room -- the first room you see when you enter the house. Welcome home, Mom and Dad!

They didn't tell me about it for years, to spare me the embarrassment. When my dad did finally tell me, he was laughing his ass off. But my mother was apparently... not pleased. 

**TL;DR - My childhood dog spread my used condoms all over my parents' living room.**

So what’s your story?"
795,AskReddit,I just got the worst Christmas Gift ever. What do I do?,"**Thank you all for your help. See edit 6 for what happened today. I felt this was getting long so I put it at the end. Damn that 10000 chars limit. Original post below:**

So this year has been pretty tranquil for me; I had a promotion, had excellent stock returns and got rid of most of my debts. I, however, got a quite unexpected Christmas gift and am unsure of how to deal with it.

My wife told me she had one gift for me this year: a very special gift. Keep in mind she told me about this in November; between that date and Christmas, we ate, lived and slept together. I would never have expected this.


Her ""only"" gift wasn't expensive furniture, watch or perfume: she had filed divorce paper. Not only that, she watched me open the big box where she put the little letter in front of our two children. We have been married for 12 years. 

She insisted I opened this gift at the end, after all gifts had been opened. At first I thought it was a joke. The form was accompanied with a court date, her asked conditions, as well as a letter from a lawyer she hired, saying she was asking for full custody of our children.

I could barely talk. Nothing had gone particularly wrong and nothing had changed. I had not noticed any change in her attitude, except maybe she looked a bit more tired, but I assumed it was due to the upcoming christmas. She was smiling all the time.

She wouldn't even tell me why she filed for divorce. As a matter of fact, I still do not know. I am now alone, our two children are asleep and she went to celebrate with her family. Yes, all alone on the night of christmas. I am at a loss for words.

I do not know what to do Reddit. Please help me. Why did she file these papers? Why did she play this game, ruining my and our children's christmas? That's not only cruel for me, but for them, as well, which is what I really don't understand. Thank you. It really help just writing the story.


**EDIT6**

Alright here's what happened since yesterday. I took my kids to bed and spend most of the night on Reddit. The FFFFFUUUUUUU, the funny and the pics sections were particularly helpful in passing the long hours. I'd like to thank all redditors for their help and input. They really helped me. This story is not yet getting to a end and I feel my nightmare is only about to begin, but at least now I have an idea where to begin. As I have said in another comment, I normally wouldn't share something so private but with all the incredible support I have gotten, I would feel bad not bringing this matter to an end.

First, the punchline: my wife is currently interned at a mental hospital and the psychiatrist refuses to let her out. It is now 4:30. I am back from a short visit with her, and the psychiatrist evaluating her. She is considered a high-level threat to herself and locked in a small room with a bed. She looked pitiful at best, nothing like the woman I loved, and married. I had a short meeting with the psychiatrist who explained what was happening. He was great in explaining **any legal paper filed in the last month has absolutely no legal value, and that he would testify about it**. That's already a great thing I guess but after all this... Heh. My wife will remain at the hospital until monday where she will get evaluated again. 

For all of those wondering how I could live with her for 12 years and not realize a thing, I would reply I was blind, naive and dumb. Overall these 12 years have been good and I have considered myself ""happy."" I now realize it was all a lie. I fail to realize how exactly I could be so blind. I do remember a couple of particular scenes. This one is at a restaurant - keep in mind we were both pretty normal, she was smiling and happy until I said this line:

ME: This salad is great.

HER: Oh, yeah, right?

ME: What's wrong?

HER: Of course, the restaurant's salad got to be better than the one I make, huh?

ME: No, yours is good too.

HER: You always think everything is better when it's made by another person. Everyone does everything better than me. This salad is better than mine.

ME: I did not say this. Your salad is great. This one is great too.

HER: @£¤@£ YOU! I'M FED UP WITH YOU. I WANT TO GO HOME NOW.

She was seriously mad, I even thought she would hit me. I thought it was just normal behavior or that she was in a bad mood. I didn't think much of it, or of the tons of events that happened after (one time at a Home Depot. ME: I need some rope. Which one do you think is best? HER: I don't know. Take the one I can hang myself with.)

So why here, why now? According to what she has said, my wife believed I was having an affair. It goes further than this, and is EXTREMELY hard for me to believe: **SHE BELIEVES HER KIDS ARE NOT HERS**. Yes,**she believes I made kids with that other woman I was cheating with, a woman that doesn't even exist!** I can barely believe it right now, it's all so sudden and a shock, but that's what she said, black and white, to the psychiatrist evaluating her.  I have a meeting with a psychiatrist monday. I basically have to decide what I will do.

I think the fact she thought I was having an affair really tipped her off. I do realize now I acted a bit suspicious and I blame myself for it. For example I would remain at work later some nights. Once, she almost ""caught"" me when I went out on Friday with some coworkers (I am supposed to get back home and help our children do their homework, and help with chores, and eat with my family) telling her I had too much work and would work late. She did call the office and they told her I was not there and that I ""went out"". I think this, and many years of small events, really tipped her off.

I don't know what to do. I am glad I was able to see through all this but at the same time I feel even stranger. She was pregnant for nine months, two times. We had pictures of her during her pregnancy. All her friends saw her pregnant. Any DNA test will confirm it (not that we should need them). Her name is on the birth certificate, she was admitted at the hospital, she saw her kids every day for years... Why...

I feel betrayed, and horrible. One thing she did was calling the police on me, although she had been kind enough not to tell them the children were in immediate danger. They came here early in the morning (just after I called the first attorney). Thanks to one redditor in particular everything that could potentially compromise me was already out. They came in, asked me if they could talk to me right there, and I accepted. I offered them some coffee (they declined) and told them what happened. They were surprisingly nice. I was fearing a bit the ""my husband is a violent man, I had to ran away"" but nothing of this happened. I showed them the papers, they took some notes, briefly checked around the house (at my request) and went away. I asked them if a medical examination on my children was necessary in case she accused me of domestic violence. They told me it was not necessary at the moment. Later on I called another attorney (who did recommend a medical examination), and deposited everything I had related to this story at his place, including many pages of notes. He listened to my story, took some notes, was very compassionate with me and told me to take it easy, and change the locks if I did not feel safe. We will meet again on Monday. One more thing I should said: after that ""gift"" she went to her parents' house and it wasn't the ""Haha you finally left that dumb husband of yours"" (her parents do not like me very much). It was short, she went to sleep and the next days she was even madder - made threats about cutting herself everywhere, and her family thought it was better to take her away, to professionals. According to the little I've heard she was crying hysterically non-stop. I've only seen her like this a few times, and I thought it had to do with her period.

The hospital called me as a ""relative"" of her. I spoke briefly on the phone and rushed there. I asked if I should bring the kids and the lady on the phone told me ""no"". I would learn a bit later why.

She was in hospital clothes. I barely saw for a minute, if that. She had no interest in seeing me at the moment. She looked tired, sad ... It's hard to explain. The psychiatrist read me about what had happened, gave me some advice, and told me she would need more evaluation. Meh, just thinking about this whole meeting makes me tired. She did say she thought her kids ""weren't hers"". When she was told there were many photographies of her being pregnant, she said it was faked, and that it is all conspired against her. I was cheating on her, she was convinced of it.

Here I am, about to cook again for two kids who might never see ""their"" mother, the mother they knew for years, ever again. I am alone, I feel horrible, and still angry and lost about that night. I wish I could portray her in a better light: she was a wonderful women with whom I felt in love and still loved to this day. She was happy, beautiful, smiling, loved art and sports and a very good mother for all these years. And now it all vanished, perhaps forever.

I am stuck with the choice of stopping all this. Fighting her dirty war. Going on with the divorce  and fighting for full custody. My priority are my kids and I do not want them to suffer more. They had a terrible, sad christmas and they might never recover from it. I lied to them, telling them she was sick but would get better very very soon, but I don't think they believed me. The truth is: I don't have any idea. I'm crying right now while typing this: I have to be strong for them, I guess. I have to choose between staying with her, ""forgiving"" her and going on with that relationship, or quitting her and living my life.

I never saw that coming from a mile. In barely 24 hours I lost everything I had. I have no idea what to do. Thank you for all the support Reddit you've been fantastic. Sorry for the long post - for now I have no idea what to do. "

797,AskReddit,Today a racist man who used to torment me as a kid came into my business to ask for a job. What was the longest you've waited for karma to kick in?,"
Tonight a guy walks into my family's convenience store to buy a pack of cigarettes. I know him from my days growing up here. Him and his younger brother used to give me a hard time, they were real bullies, racist types who encouraged others to pick on me and even to turn violent against me. I hated him, and his family, for taking a part of my childhood.

He was unusually friendly tonight, smiling at me and cracking shitty jokes that I smiled politely at but didn't really respond to. He counted his money with his gimp hand, which was partially blown in half (taking several fingers with it) by fireworks that blew up in his hand a few years ago. I gave him his smokes and change, said thanks, and went about my business. 

Before leaving, he stops, hesitates for a moment, and turns around to ask me if there are any job openings at the store. While I had heard him correctly, it's almost as if the words didn't register in my mind, so I asked him to repeat himself. He asks again, 'you wouldn't happen to have any jobs available, would you?' 

I explain that we're sufficiently staffed at the moment, that with my sister and I around for the summer that we wouldn't be needing anyone else to fill in the hours, which were sparse enough as is. I told him to ask again in the fall, when I'd return to Montreal and my sister to university. He said that it was okay, but that he needed something now because he was just left by his wife. He said thanks anyways, and walked out.

Memories of him being a jackass flashed around in my head, and through these a clearer picture began to form. When he had just graduated highschool, his parents broke up in a massive way, leaving a fractured home for his younger siblings to grow up in. Sometime in his life he experienced his hand being blown apart by an explosive. He had amounted to very little, and his marriage was falling apart. And now, he had to come asking for a job from the local nigger he used to make fun of and claim superiority over throughout his life. I'm half white and brown, btw, not black, but to people in this part of the world, if you're not white then you're a chink or a nigger.

It didn't feel good. I should have enjoyed it, but I didn't. While I don't feel bad for him, not in the slightest, I don't feel like any kind of justice was served, or that karma had given him his comeuppance. If the universe is truly neutral towards what is right and wrong, then this was just the way that life played out for someone who did a lot of harm to people in his time. He could have been rich, he could have been powerful, he could have kept the use of both of his hands. But it didn't turn out that way. Karma had nothing to do with it, there was no justice.

What occurred to me is that I'm not at all connected to this place anymore, this village where I grew up, not even to the pain and harsh memories that stayed with me for years. I've become my own person, capable of, at least on some level, sympathizing even with the scum of the universe that tormented my childhood, and to forget about the painful memories that followed me well into my twenties, as echoes from the past. 

I just wanted to share this, because I thought it was interesting.

TL;DR: A bully from my childhood who used to attack me and incite others to do so came into my store and asked me for a job. Life's like that."
799,AskReddit,"Reddit, can you help me get this story out? Cops screw over Dad; conspire and spin an accident report, all caught on tape. ","My friend's Dad (Kevin) was recently in an accident that involved him running his motorcycle into a police car. The cop made an illegal left hand turn without looking, causing Kevin to smash into cop car. The cop gets out of the car and immediately admits fault and asks if everything is okay. Soon thereafter the cop's superiors arrive on the scene and begin having a conversation about how to spin the story to make it look like it was Kevin's fault. All of this (Luckily), audio and video, is caught on the police cruiser's video cam.

So... expecting the police to cover the damages to his bike, because that's all he wanted. Kevin goes into the police station the next day and finds that not only are they not going to cover his damages, but they are now charging him with failing to yield to an emergency vehicle, and are submitting the cost for their damages, to his insurance.

So basically the cops try to flip the story and screw him.... Luckily he manages to get his hands on the police cruiser tape. Which has the full conversations of the cops deciding how to spin the story, and the original officer admitting it was his fault. The cops have since tried to settle and get the story to go away, because there is so much evidence against them. But now Kevin just wants to get the word out about the story, and try to get something actually changed, instead of just taking the cash and shutting up.

So reddit, could you please help me get the word out? Maybe forward the story to others who might be interested, journalist friends, blogs? Any advice or help is appreciated. Thanks!

**EDIT:** People keep asking how he got his hands on the tape: 
From Thebarron00 (Kevin's son Nick.)
&gt;Thanks LeonTrolsky, and thanks you for all the support reddit, I'm Kevin's son Nick.
And in regards to how he got the tape, he learned that whenever the sirens turn on a microphone is enabled. Knowing that there was a recording, he filed a California Public Records Act, and 4 weeks later he had a copy in his mailbox.
Feel free to ask any other questions and I'll answer what I can.

**EDIT 2:** Awesome! Thanks for all the support and help Reddit! We'll continue to answer as many of your questions as we can, and keep you updated on any developments. THANKS!

**EDIT 3:** The cop's siren and lights were on. Yes, but they were flicked on as he begins to make the illegal turn, pulling out in front of a motorcycle going full speed. Kevin tries to stop, but he simply doesn't have time:
&gt;""I came out and -- yeah I didn't see you coming down there -- you know -- either. I turned the lights and siren on up there, and I tried to go slow around the other car but... ""(Cop)

&gt;""I slammed on the brakes,"" interrupted Halliburton (Kevin), ""but if he's coming out there no way I can stop in time.""

&gt;""Yeah . . . no, yeah,"" Froome (Cop) replied, ""I'm sorry.""

**TL;DR** - Friend's Dad was trolled by cops. Cop made an illegal left hand turn without looking, causing Friend's Dad to smash into cop car with his motorcycle. Cop immediately admits he's in the wrong, then his superiors gets there and they spin the story. End up charging Friend's Dad with an offense and trying to make him pay for the accident. ALL CAUGHT ON TAPE! Can anyone offer advice, or help, on getting his story out? Thanks!

I always just assumed that they, like many couples, didn't get along and went their separate ways. But, things have always been very civil between my parents, no arguing over me or money.

A few weeks ago, I was talking with my brother, and I found out why they **really** got divorced. My mother had gotten tired of my dad being gone for work so much, and felt neglected. She met a lesbian woman at work, and they started hanging out pretty often. My mom decided that she enjoyed the company of a woman better, and she left my dad for that woman. 

My mother, siblings, and I all moved in with that woman. We lived there for about a year, I suppose. I have absolutely no memory of that period. And until a few months ago, I had never heard her name mentioned before.

TL;DR: My mother left my dad for a lesbian coworker.

Since then, my mother has only dated men (as far as I know), so the whole thing came as a complete surprise to me.

But there is still the question of what to do with my son?","Well, I guess let's start at the beginning. I know most of you might not know my story, so here's my original 3 posts detailing what has happened with my family over the last several months. 

-[
First post, where I found out my son had sexually abused my dog with a hairbrush and wanted advice on how to deal with it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s1o90/i_think_my_teenage_son_may_have_sodomized_our_dog/) 


-[Second post, where I find out my son has gone back on his word and the dog has been abused again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vemi5/i_am_the_father_and_redditor_whose_son_sodomized/) 


-[Third post, where after all of this drama over our son and shaky marriage, my wife and I separate and I lose my son and dog.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yc7zo/update_i_am_the_father_and_redditor_whose_teenage/) 



To put a long story short, I discovered my teenaged son had sexually abused our family dog, Colby, with a hairbrush and his fingers a few months ago. After I confronted him about it, he confessed, and promised never to do it again, and in return I agreed to keep it between him and I and not tell his mom. 

A while later, I discovered my son reneged on his promise to me, and had abused the dog again. This time I felt I had to bring my wife into the matter, and when I told her, it all blew up in my face. She couldn't believe her son would do that sort of a thing, and she eventually got it into her head somehow that it must have been ME that abused the dog. A short while after telling her about these incidents, we separated, and she wound up with the dog and my son, who when confronted went back and denied that he had ever done anything to the dog, despite admitting to me that he had (and me actually catching him in the act a different time). 

So the last time I updated, I had been living at a friends house while my wife and son (and Colby) stayed at the family house. My wife was somehow convinced that I was the abused of our dog and that I was blaming it on my son (which is maybe the most confusing and infuriating feeling I have ever had). 

I tried calling my son for several days in hope that I could convince him to come clean and help get us on the road to fixing our family. He did not pick up nor did he ever call me back. So about 2 weeks ago I decided to show up at the house when I knew they would all be there. I knocked on the door and my wife would not answer it. 

I admit I kind of lost it and started shouting and pounding on it, and she eventually came outside, where a yelling match ensued between her and I in the front yard. I finally left after she just put her hands over her ears and started yelling ""dog fucker, dog fucker, dog fucker"" over and over again to try to humiliate me in front of the neighborhood. As I walked back to my car fuming I looked back at the house and saw my son staring at me from the second story window with a blank look on his face. I stared at him and shook my head in disappointment, but he didn't change his expression. I have to admit, that really broke my heart &amp; pissed me off. 

So fast forward to just a couple days ago. I am at work, nearing the end of my day, when suddenly my phone rings and it's my wife. I pick it up, and she's sobbing and obviously very upset. She tells me that Colby has bitten my son, and he has gone to the hospital to get stitches. She says Colby bit him in the lower abdomen, 2 times. She doesn't know what to think. Obviously, I know exactly what happened. I could tell she finally knew I was right. Colby would NEVER bite anyone unprovoked, he is an incredibly friendly dog and has no history of biting or being aggressive at all.

When we got off the phone, I felt this rage building inside of me. I felt like it was finally time for this shit to end. Colby had stood up for himself against my son, who had betrayed both of us. I couldn't prove it, but I just *know* my son was abusing the dog again, and I felt responsible for having left him alone with Colby all of these times. It was like Colby finally lashed out in desperation after having nobody there to protect him. I felt sick to my stomach for having abandoned my dog with my kid, who obviously doesn't give a fuck about me or any of us, as long as he can keep getting away with shit. 

I left work and went straight to the family home. This time, my wife answered the door and let me in. I went straight to my sons room, where he was laying down watching TV. He looked at me in surprise and I told him not to talk. I basically said ""I know what you did, you can deny it and you can blame me all you want, but you and I both know what happened. I am taking the dog, and if I ever find out you go near an animal like this again I will report you to the police, I don't care if you are my son. This is disgusting and unfair, and I raised you better"". Obviously I said more than that, but that was the gist of it. He was extremely uncomfortable.

Then I went downstairs and out the back door to get the dog. I put a leash and Colby and walked him back through the house, and my wife stopped me and told me she was sorry. We talked for about 5 minutes, and we both got a little weepy. She asked me to forgive her, which I told her I did. She then invited me to stay at the house, to which I said no. I'm not ready for that, and Colby deserved better, I had already let him down too many times. 

I left her crying in the house, and put Colby in the car. We drove back to my friends place, where I am staying. I've since been looking for a small apartment with a short term lease that accepts dogs, as I have decided that I am not going to move back in with my family. At least not in the immediate future. Colby is finally with me, and is safe, and I need time to think about what our next move should be. I know that asking my friend to house me and now a dog is pushing the bounds of his good grace, so this is what has to happen. 

A lot of you have written to me asking for updates, and I apologize for not getting back to all of you. Mostly, I had no significant changes in the situation until all of this. But I thought you all deserved to know that the dog is safe. 

However, I still do not know what I am going to do about my son &amp; wife. Do you think I should report him as is? The more I think about it, the more I am sure he will probably just do this again. Colby might be safe, but I am still, despite all he's done to me, worried about my son. He is a minor, so legally I am still responsible for him. What sort of thing does one do for somebody who does this?"

Closing my eyes was making me dizzy and any movement in my sight line was making me uncomfortable.

I watched her 5 minutes doing the same thing before I made sure she was stupid as a clam and then I reached over to her screen slowly, pressed the 2 inch wide power button with the power mark on it, looked at her eyes and calmly said ""This is how you turn on the system"". She was looking so stupefied that I remember thinking she would probably get an orgasm if I teach her the function of ESC button. Only 2 hours later I realized the screen's brightness was so low that it was seen as black when you look at it from the sides although it was open and running.

840,AskReddit,[Modpost] Small rule changes to the subreddit. Please read and be aware.,"Hi all,

The mods have been reviewing our rules and have decided to make some small changes to the rules to make them shorter, clearer and reflect how we actually moderate the subreddit. Most of the changes are in clarity but there is one new rule:

&gt; Askreddit is not your personal army or advertising platform. Please do not post questions clearly designed to garner attention for a cause, gain free publicity or publicly shame a person or company. If your post has any other purpose than creating discussion, it will be removed.

We felt that, quite often, people would throw a question on the end when the intention of the post was reaching a lot of people with **their message** and not **starting a discussion**.

Please take some time to look at the other changes ----&gt;

and reply to this post telling us what you think.

Kind Regards,

The Modteam


Edit 1: A lot of people asking for examples so here goes:

The following will **no longer be allowed**:

&gt; X company did Y and Z to me. How can I get the word out about the way they're scamming their customers?

You can see clearly that the question was tacked on at the end as an excuse to fit it into the subreddit. The main intention of the post is to complain about the company and tell as many people as possible. If you **really want to ask a question like that** we almost certainly won't think you're trying to circumvent the system if you simply **leave out the name of the company/person/subreddit** etc.

Edit 2: Protip: You're not the first or last to say ""At least you're not jesus"" to me or some variation.

Edit 3 - **Story posts**: I'm getting a lot of questions about this so I thought I should add an edit. Due to **overwhelming** popularity, we are **not** outlawing story posts. We've asked the sub many times before and it's clear that people want them to remain. Again, our criteria for posts is about whether the OP is asking for opinions/discussion or simply using askreddit as their soapbox. While it's subtle, there is an important difference between the story posts where someone says ""X, Y and Z happened to me, when has X, Y and Z happened to you?"" and ""Company X did Y and Z to me, how do I get the word out?"". The difference is that the story posts is asking for other people's opinions/stories and generating discussion. The company post is clearly just an attempt to spread information."

844,AskReddit,"Reddit, what's your craziest ""I can explain!"" moment? A friend once popped the trunk of his car, revealing a naked man, and the explanation was (relatively) reasonable.","Here's the full story from the title:  
  
First, some background info. I live in Pennsylvania and you're allowed to (and usually have to) pump your own gas. In New Jersey, it's illegal to pump your own gas.  
  
So, some friends are driving around New Jersey. Said friend is the member of a band and, with him, is the other 3 members of his band, his girlfriend, and another friend. That's 6 people. The car only has seats for 5. So, on a trip to the gas station, one bandmate figures it'd be fun to ride in the trunk.  
  
This guy is a bit crazy in the best way. On the way from the venue to the gas station, while in the trunk, he gets totally naked save for a pink bandana around his neck so he can surprise the shit out of everyone when they get back.  
  
The car arrives at the gas station and, realizing they have to let someone pump their gas, they pull up to a pump and an attendant comes to help them. When he asks my friend to open the door covering the gas valve thingy, with him being used to manually opening it himself (as opposed to using the automatic button inside the car), he fumbles around for the button...  
  
And pops the trunk.  
  
There lays a naked man, who looks a bit like a beardless Jesus, wearing nothing but a pink bandana.  
  
The best part is my friend didn't even realize it was the wrong button. So, the attendant just stands there awkwardly as the guy in the trunk tries to shut the trunk while everyone in the car sits looking bored with straight faces.  
  
So, what do you peoples got?  
  
**EDIT:** I forgot to mention: I told them he should have gotten out of the trunk, walked over, opened the door on the gas thingy, walked back, got back into the trunk, and closed it. Nothing more amazing could have happened.
  
**EDIT:** I made the front page! Woot! The band in the above story, Eye on Attraction, is releasing a new album that you can get [here](http://eyeonattraction.bigcartel.com/product/the-factory-cd). [Here's](http://www.facebook.com/EyeOnAttraction/app_178091127385) their Facebook page. Aaaand, [here's some soundcloud tracks](http://soundcloud.com/eyeonattraction/sets/the-factory-2/)!

845,AskReddit,"Just saw a mother walk into a classroom with a handheld Radiation Meter and proceed to tell the teacher that little Billy needs to sit in the back corner of the classroom because of the toxic school wifi radiation.

852,AskReddit,"""If you choose to live in another country, you have the responsibility to become fluent in that countries national language.""

I work with countless people from around the globe, and some yes, have been in Canada for 10+ years and still speak only the tongue of their home country.

Do you think that someone who immigrates to a new country should be mandated to learn the national language, or is it up to the individual and if they can function without it than let them choose.

Thanks for the input!

EDIT #1: YES, I made a grammar error with ""countries"" and not ""country's."" I didn't proofread obviously, and by the time I noticed I didn't want to delete it.
EDIT #2: I have received a couple really horrid messages calling me a racist for posting this question, which saddens me since that was never my intention.

856,AskReddit,How long after someone is dead do you think 'grave-robbing' turns into 'archaeology'?,"Basically inspired by [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/10vk7y/i_flipped_over_a_paving_stone_in_my_yard_and/c6h25v7) from UNEification. The actual, legal answer for each country can probably be Googled, but I am curious about where Redditors would draw the line.

My own take is that it never does. I'm horribly uneasy when tombs are taken apart and put into museums, and even more uneasy about museum collections of human bones, neatly labelled in drawers. It seems disrespectful.

EDIT: I wasn't expecting this to get so... busy. I've learned a lot about ethics and archaeology, past and present, in different countries and I've enjoyed the very wide range of views, right from bodies don't matter, to the feeling that bodies shouldn't be disturbed, and from the idea that bodies remain sacred as long as their previous inhabitants are remembered, to the idea that burial is unnecessary pollution, as well as the clear distinction many draw between grave-robbing and archaeology at all periods, and those who see no distinction ever. And the thing is, right across the board I can see where people are coming from.  

My apologies also to someone whose message I did not see until this morning after I woke up. "
857,AskReddit,[UPDATE] Need help getting something done? I have unlimited flight benefits this summer and want to spend my summer helping out Redditors.,"I've spent the last week creating a **potential** [Mission List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoJOerTtEYWWdFZ5UmUzYXZGaExxbHdEeEtPZjJJaXc#gid=0) from the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/), planning, getting shots, and PMing redditors across the planet.  Due to the number of suggested missions and me realizing how one-in-a-lifetime this is, I will be ReVenturing till approximately July 20th.


I leave for San Francisco tomorrow (Monday, May 7th) to meet up with [Zajoba](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/c4hhyul?context=3) and attempt to accomplish the following missions:


* #0033 - seamstressofink - help paint living room
* #0041 - oliversmom - bring UK plug adapter and mow lawn or wash car
* #0187 - housechore - Sail out around the golden gate bridge

I'll be posting future updates /r/ReVenture, videos to my [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheReVenture), and tweets to [my twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/RedthePirate).  

If you have ideas for potential Missions (or are on the current [Mission List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoJOerTtEYWWdFZ5UmUzYXZGaExxbHdEeEtPZjJJaXc#gid=0)) or want to hang out/do something if/when I'm in your town, **please PM with your email or phone number- I have been finding that communication via Reddit messages alone is not in everyone's best interests.**

My rough itinerary (subject to change- but fear not, I have many backup Mission destinations) is as follows:

[May 7th - May 10th: San Francisco, California](http://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/t8oak/reventures_first_stop_san_francisco/)

May 10th - May 12th: Seattle, Washington

May 13th - 15th: Marrakesh, Morocco (specifically the Atlas Mountains)

May 16th - 18th: the sky (reading Buffy comics and editing videos to keep my sanity up)

May 18th - 19th: Seoul, South Korea

858,AskReddit,Hey Reddit. What things do you do with your S.O. that you'd never want another person to witness?,"Just a few of mine. 

* When my boyfriend and I shower together, we do a ritual butt-dance. We rub our butts together in an up and down and then side to side fashion and exclaim we're married

* Sometimes when I leave the bedroom after sex, he'll steal a pair of my underwear, hide them somewhere, and when accused will say ""but it's my friend""

* Whenever he bends over, his butt-crack shows a little. I put things in it. My favorite was a drinking straw that I then proceeded to blow into, causing his cheeks to vibrate. We call it the ""reverse fart""


**EDIT**: Wow! Thanks for the response, Reddit! I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. I can't say I'm surprised that butt-dancing is as popular as you have made it out to be. If you haven't yet, I urge you to try it with your loved one, dry *or* soapy.  

On a more serious note, I don't think the weirdness we share is anything to be ashamed of, and like many of you have mentioned, it's these unique secret codes and languages that bring us together. I sincerely hope that anyone out there who hasn't found this with a person (and who wants to) will hold out for someone who can put down the sword and shield, and just be a goof. We spend enough time putting on airs for others that it feels nice to just let loose and have a laugh at the silliness of it all. "

860,AskReddit,Should there be penalties for deliberately spreading disinformation to mislead the public on scientific facts in order to promote industry agendas?,"As examples, I bring up the disinformation campaigns waged by the tobacco industry (denying that smoking caused cancer), the aerosol industry (denying that CFCs damaged the ozone layer), and the oil and gas industry (denying anthropogenic climate change). 

I am not necessarily an advocate of increased regulation as a blanket solution, but would, at a minimum, like to see public policy based on an evidence-based reality as opposed to ideology or profit maximization.

When these industry groups deliberately obfuscate the weight of scientific evidence by either attacking legitimate scientists or sowing unjustified doubt in the mass media, they are delaying necessary action that results in avoidable damages. 

I know that civil suits are one way to go about this, but they haven't proven to be particularly effective in a reasonable time frame (it took decades before lawsuits against big tobacco were finally being settled in favor of the plaintiffs, and countless cancer deaths and other related health issues in the interim). 

Are there ways to make these sorts of activities more legally actionable? If so, what would they be? 

What are the implications on Freedom of Speech? 

What mechanisms could be put into place to distinguish between the malicious and the ignorant? 

Is the onus on the public to self-educate? 

I'd like to know what Reddit thinks.

EDIT: I also want to make it clear that the intent is not to stifle opinions I don't agree with by punishing disagreeable thought. What I want to discourage is the deliberate spreading of facts that are demonstrably false with the express purpose of confusing the public and furthering a political or corporate agenda. 

While I understand there are mechanisms (i.e. civil suits or criminal proceedings in the case of deliberate fraud) in place for those rare instances where intent can be proven and harm can be measured, there are many instances of such behavior that goes unpunished, on both ends of the political spectrum. Just because there is insufficient evidence to warrant legal action, it is still wrong. 

Regardless of party affiliation, there should be some accountability, particularly for those who are in positions of power and influence who I believe should be held to a higher standard. Although a government imposed penalty system would be susceptible to abuse and is not likely the right solution, we still need to come up with better ways to change the system in order to encourage due diligence and intellectual integrity amongst those making public statements that can have wide-reaching effects.

Libel is considered to be illegal when directed towards an individual. So why is it okay when it is directed towards an issue that affects everyone?"
864,AskReddit,"My dad passed away recently, leaving me as my 81 y.o. German grandmother's only relative. Reddit, I want to send her something every day for the next year to stave off her boredom.

This has been an amazingly therapeutic experience, and I can't wait to start putting all of these ideas to good use.

I have decided to send her an envelope or box every two weeks with smaller envelopes inside.

For those interested in sending something, the PO Box address is:

340 E 1st St #3973
Tustin, CA 92780

My Oma's name is Inge. She loves flowers, her house is decorated in a fake French aristocratic style (super gaudy...), and she used to own a cat (I don't know if she likes cats though...). She was a career waitress and she built her house with my grandpa. She's lived in the same village her entire life, but she always loved to travel (or, at least, the idea of traveling). She took a trip to Mallorca once that seems to have been the highlight of her life. She grew up during WWII and if I can get a couple glasses of champagne in her, she'll tell me stories from bygone days.

Postcards, letters, crafts, drawings, etc. will all be forwarded to her there. Feel free to break out the rusty college German and write a quick note if you feel like it. Anything and everything is greatly appreciated (you know, within reason...). I don't want to be picky, but if gifts can remain smallish and lightweight, that would be amazing.

The Internet is an amazing place. I'm so happy to have ""met"" all of you.

Edit: My Oma doesn't have Internet or a computer, so no Reddit for Grandma! Sorry folks!

Edit 2: Lots of people have shown interest in helping me out! If you're interested in sending me something to send to my Oma, please PM me and I'll get you the PO Box address as soon as I set one up on Monday.

Edit 3: A gold star for anyone who can figure out what this edit is about.



Backstory:

So, my dad passed away from colon cancer about three months ago. Since my dad was an only child, my Oma has very few remaining relatives. One relative is a somewhat evil sister that lives right up the street from her, who preceded to chastise my grandmother when she called to tell her that my dad had died). The other remaining relatives are my mother and half-sister, who don't speak German.

I'm trying really hard to be there for my grandmother, but I live in California. I call her every week, but the conversations are starting to get to me: she's so lonely and bored and I think she's really lost the will to live.

Now, I don't have any delusions about how much I can change this situation from abroad. I'll be in Germany next summer, but until then, I was thinking that I might send her a little envelope every day. It could have a picture or a saying or just a ""how ya doin'?"" type of note inside. Since y'all are always so creative, I was thinking maybe you might be able to give me some more unique ideas. 

Many thanks!"
865,AskReddit,"Today at work, my manager defended me thoroughly against an out of order customer (story inside). What's the nicest thing your co-workers have done for you?","I work in a supermarket cafe and I have mild eczema on my forearms. For anyone who doesn't know, eczema is a skin condition where your skin is flaky, red raw, scabbed up, sore.

My eczema is visible at work and no customer has every complained about it ever up until today.

I took food over to the shithead customer and after I walked away, he called my manager over and said that I should cover up my eczema because it was putting him off of his meal.

My manager's face instantly changed and he looked so angry. He came over and told me what the customer had said.

I felt extremely offended and wanted to cry. This customer has essentially said I was so off putting that he couldn't eat his meal.

My manager went over to the customer and in the most stern but polite fashion, said ""Not only have you deeply offended my worker but you have offended me. Eczema isn't contagious nor is it unhygienic. If you feel as if my worker is putting you off of your food simply due to his skin then I ask that you leave this cafe and grow up.""

If you would like to discuss it with its author he is on the forums linked at the bottom.**
******
Where we are - it appears we have statistical proof of vote flipping in the Primary. Much of the research focuses on South Carolina, but we have extremely suspicious data on most other states as well, though we need to be careful since some states are primaries and others are caucuses, which need to be kept separate, even if both end up being fraudulent.

The basic summary:

1) Romney is always the only benefactor. 

2) There is evidence of vote flipping going back to the 2008 primary.

3) The algorithm(s) being used are rather crude, often basic 1:1 flipping. 

4) Votes are often, but not always, siphoned from a single candidate. This candidate is often Ron Paul, but has also been Gingrich, Santorum, and even Huckabee in 2008.

5) Romney benefits as precincts increase in size, and this increase is algorithmically 'clean' with little or no 'white noise' common to non-altered candidates. For example, we might see a steady 10% rise in Romney's votes from precincts sized 50% to 80%, at which point it increases to a steady 15% (far after any differences in size should matter).

6) Demographics are not at play, though this is the 'debunk' most often brought up by people new to the thread. 
******
A candidate's cumulative score should gradually converge with reducing volatility towards his final result. This is an absolute mathematical law. Romney's score goes there in straight slanted line with no volatility. This is simply entirely impossible in an un-rigged election. 
******
As you are versed into stats, here is what I would consider a mathematical proof of vote rigging. I apologize to our friends who will get a headache out of the analysis.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/znxHc.jpg)

Consider ballots as a random variables. Look how fast small precincts become a powerful predictor of Romney's score: a standard deviation of 0.2% as soon as the second decile, 0,1% in the 3rd!

And then? The mathematically impossible happens:

Romney's score jumps by 1%,

10 times the previous standard deviation,

every decile

FOR AN AVERAGE PRECINCT VOTE SIZE UP ONLY A COUPLE OF DOZENS OF VOTES

Are demographics of 50-vote precincts different from 70-vote precincts? No way.

The impossibly large systematic linear deviation is the mathematical smoking gun.

Look for the telltale sign: Romney's share suddenly climbs in a straight line. Paul sole provider of votes in NV, apparently.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/FHFdS.jpg)

See how undoctored counties exhibit flat lines fast, even with low population?
******

The following argument is mathematically stronger than the previous ones by several orders of magnitude.

Counting votes in a ballot is like taking marbles fron an urn until you've got them all out. Take an urn with 10 marbles, 5 reds 5 blues. You draw the 1st: probability if it being red? 50% Let' say it is red. Pick the second. Probability of being red? 4 reds left in there, so you know it is now 4 chances out of 9.

Now put a 10,000 marbles in there, 1/2 reds 1/2 blues. Pick one. Now make a chart of the cumulative % of the drawn balls that are red. Your first data point on the chart will be 0% or 100%. Draw the second ball. The 2nd data point will be 100% (drawn 2 reds), 50% (1 red, 1 blue) or 0% (no reds). As you know that your final result is 50%, the line will oscillate up and down randomly but rapidly converge towards 50%, something like this:

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/gLrof.jpg)

The mathematical law describing this process is call hypergeometric. It describes in particular the statistics of partial ballot counting! And if you tell me that Romney has got 50% of the votes in that ballot, I can tell you that he needs to be real close that 50% by the time we have counted 90% of the votes, a bit less close at 80%, etc... Poll science shows that 10/20% might suffice for the oscillator to turn into a complete flat line. But maths allow another nice trick as well. If you tell me after 25% of the votes counted what Romney's score is, I can actually tell you the probability that he will get to a score of 50% at the end of the vote tally. Isn't hypergeometry nifty?

As we have seen, Romney's lines do not converge flatly towards the final result. It does not everytime the ballot is relevent to the final outcome. His score starts by oscillating and flattening but then shoots up in a straight line in dozens of counties. That is mathematically impossible.

Let's look at the numbers of Allendale County, SC. 311 votes.

Here is a chart you are now familiar with: Candidate score vs Cumulative votes sorted by ascending vote tally

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/dcGhL.jpg)

Normal patterns, nothing special apparently. Now the hypergeometric distribution allows me to caluclate the following probabilities:

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/XWtXU.jpg)

What does it say? Take Santorum. His final score is 12%. Don't forget: this is not an estimate, it is actual. His cumulative score MUST get there. People in Fairfax No 1 are known for their superior political wisdom. Santorum gets no vote. So 23 votes have been cast. Santorum has only 311-23 votes left to go from his current 0% to 12%. Probabilitity of him getting 0% out of 23 votes cast? Hypergeometry says 5%. But he does very well in the Martin precinct (guys, get a grip, his a fake). His cumulated share of votes goes back to 10%, close to his final score of 12%. The oscillator has sent him close to the final target and the probability of that is high: now 39%. Etc... Gingrich does well early, so he then needs very little to reach his final 52%. The number reflect that. Paul was looking good all the way but is trashed in Fairfax No 2. His odds from reaching the final 7% fall suddenly from 77% to 7%. Romney needed a big last precinct to end up 29%, which he got.

So expect big volatility in the numbers as candidates outperform/underperform locally and oscillate before reaching their final score.

If we plot the last table, we obtain that cute doodle:

X axis cumulative vote, Y axis Probability of having the score X or lower.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/9EzK9.jpg)


When a Y value is at 50%, it mean that the oscillator is currently aligned with the final score. So expect to go across that line frequently. In a real world.

Ok, more example of untampered counties.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/TMlQa.jpg)

Now. Think, Winnie, think. What does it mean to be at 0%. It means that your interim cumulative score is so low that you have no chance to get back up to the final result. On the charts which will follow, 0% is always something like 0.4%, or 0.002%, or 0.0000000000000000001%. Take this one.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/RqdEF.jpg)

VOTE FLIPPER ON ALERT !!!

How do I know? Notice a difference with the previous charts? I guessed so. What are the odds when Romney is at 27% with 23% of the votes counted to end up where he did, at 32%? Hypergeometry, a law of the universe, says: 1 out of 267,385,153.

Checkmate.

Edit: for the sticklers, it's ELECTION FRAUD not voter fraud.
******
**As per the Demographic argument**
The crucial evidence being presented is that the vote percentages for Romney are steadily increasing with respect to time, in high-sample districts. This is evidence of vote rigging that is simply not contradicted by:

a) claims of statistical error

b) demographic shifts with respect to time of day

c) unevenly distributed vote tallies

Response from the Author of the original thread in response to TribbleTrouble's rebuttal below:

Pb 1: Oh dear... You know the score of 3 candidates so you can deduce the score of the 4th therefore non random variables therefore no hypergeometric function? If I give you the proportion of the red balls, can you deduce the score of the blue ones? Oh yes? Darn. Does it mean that hypergeometry cannot be applied to exhaustive ball sampling anymore? Well it still can. Still struggling big time with the basics, kid. Good luck with that exam.

Pb 2: Again, Romney does not correlate to population headcount, he correlates to RELATIVE population. This will stay beyond 98% of the audience, I have to accept it.

The numbers never ""overestimate Paul's chance of performing well"". I don't have that data. The work analyses the trajectory to the actual final ballot count, never anything else. Very confused student again.

903,AskReddit,"On my grandmothers death bed, she asked me ""Do you know who your real mother is?"". What major ""plot twist"" moment have you had in your life?","My grandmother passed away just over two weeks ago. The family all went to see her for the last time. She was surprising aware of everything around her, and telling stories/joking.

I went and sat by her, and we talked for a little while about various things. Out of nowhere she said ""Do you know who your real mother is?""... Now, I have only ever known one woman to be my mother, and had never considered otherwise. I was shocked, and asked her to repeat herself, thinking I misheard her.

She said it again ""Do you know who your real mother is?"". I looked over to my aunt, with a confused look on my face, who addressed my grandmother ""*** is his mother Nanny!"". My grandmother laughed for a second and said ""Oh yeah, I guess I know who your mother is too!"".

Now, I'm fairly certain my mother is actually my mother. Since then, I have been trying to justify her saying that though. All I can think is either, she was very out of it and didn't know what she was saying. Or, there is someone else in my family who doesn't know their real mother, and she mistook me for them.

I'm not sure I should pursue this any further with my family, as any reason to keep it secret is probably a decent one. And I'm not so sure I want to know the answer.

I'll be appearing as a guest on the Daily Show this evening and was wondering if the hive mind had any recommendations. Mentioning CISPA to a producer was the first thought that came to mind... any others?

And it's not an AMA, so maybe I don't need proof, but here's some anyway in case you're wondering if this is legit:

EDIT: 

**Top Five Requests**

1. Get Jon Stewart to do an AMA--I will mention this to his executive producer, give him some information about what they are, how much traffic they get and how to contact the /r/IamA mods, probably can't mention it during the interview, but will certainly bring it to his attention if possible backstage. 

2. Mention CISPA--If we get to a natural part of the interview where it makes sense to do this, I will certainly mention it in the interview. 

3. ~~Tell him the Earth is spinning the wrong way~~--thought this was a hilarious idea at first, maybe a great way to end things, but upon further reflection--and the fact that it now has fewer upvotes than the LameMeme recommending I don't do it, I'm going to pass.

4. Look right in the camera just as I'm about to leave and say ""Kendall Gibson, we know what you have done."" so as to make ky1e's brother have a heart attack--not so sure about this one. Wouldn't want to be held liable for an emergency room visit... And there are probably easier ways to cause a heart attack. 

5. Do an AMA afterward--tomorrow is going to be crazy busy because I'm here in NYC (and on the show in the first place) to promote my book, but I'll take lots of pictures and if there's interest, will do one later this week.

Thanks so much everyone!

EDIT II: 

1. Definitely hoping to mention Amendment One in North Carolina.

2. I'm going to mention to a producer that it would be amazing if he'd host a presidential debate. This seems like a way, way, WAY long shot, but goddamit, that would be amazing. 


**EDIT THE THIRD**

Just got back from taping. Didn't manage to mention CISPA during the interview, but gave the producer I worked with a facts sheet and explained that it was basically the latest iteration of SOPA/PIPA and great comedic fodder. She seemed both genuinely interested and unaware of its existence. Hoping this happens. I was really sad we didn't have an opportunity to talk about it naturally, but, as a bunch of people pointed out in the thread, forcing it would have backfired. 

I talked with his personal assistant about an AMA, who said that it sounded like a good opportunity and would pass it directly on to Jon's agent, who makes those kinds of decisions. Obviously there are incredible demands on his time, but I mentioned how much we enjoyed NDT's AMA's and it seems he and Jon are pretty close, so fingers are crossed. "

More discussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ueu4j/karmanaut_is_at_it_again_shitty_watercolour/

Edit 1- Thank you Shitty_Watercolour for letting us know your side. Please don't delete your post because it's a weekend and lots of Redditors might be drunk, wasted, or sex-tired and may not be Redditing. They need to hear your side so that they won't just proclaim Karmanaut as anything as they want without justification that indeed you are on the right side of things. People love what you do inasmuch as you love it so don't let others take that away from you. Let your self-expression overpower other's unfair oppression.   

Edit 2- Shitty_Watercolour , if it's worth your time, you can read all the Redditor's response which mostly praises and adores your work. If thousands, if not millions, of strangers rally behind you though it does not affect their life condition in any way, then you know the hivemind's spirit is with you. Hope that is enough to still fuel your drive and motivation to create shitty watercolor paintings.

Edit 3- Does anybody know if it's possible to remove a moderator from a subreddit if majority of the subscribers asks for it? Anybody knows the process? Is it possible?

Edit 4- To those saying what's the point of this or this is just a waste of time, I hope you will realize that there are things that will make us rich and there are those that will make us great. Nobody may give you a plaque or an award or a shitload of karma but you yourself is aware that in one point of Reddit's history, you stood up for someone, in the name of greater good. That is greatness in character. And you don't just get that from anywhere or anyone, you have to earn it.

Edit 5- Let's give Pteraspidomorphi comment some consideration because it actually makes sense: ""I like shitty watercolour as much as the next man, but there is a blatant breach of rediquette going on here. Karmanaut replied to a bunch of comments here and was downvoted, often hundreds of times, effectively censoring his side of the story.

Years later, I found out that it made him realize that he drank too much around me (only a couple with dinner, but enough for a 5year old to obviously notice) and went sober for a long time.  

Obviously it didn't seem like a big deal to little me, for I thought that dads drinking beer was normal.  But my Dad felt it necessary to stop drinking around me to raise me in a healthier environment.

When he told me about this, I cried.  I had no idea little me had such an impact.  He has kept the button to this day.  

Is there anything you've done that had an unknown impact on your parents?"
914,AskReddit,Would you accept a single 2 minute ad at the start of your Netflix viewing in exchange for a vastly extended viewing library?,"I'm going back and forth between Hulu and Netflix, and I would never accept commercial breaks in my videos, but I think I could handle a single commercial if it meant I wasn't having to constantly pick through second-hand, never-heard-of, knock-off, straight-to-videos to find decent films at the ratio I do now.

915,AskReddit,"For the past couple of years, my ex wife has flown in to town and taken our two daughters elaborate, expensive birthday outings... shopping trips to New York, etc... For the past couple of years, she's called to say that she can't make it out for my son's birthday at all. ","Background:  Yes, she is his biological mother.  I don't know why I wrote ""my"" son, but I'm sure it's some deep-seated psychological acknowledgment that she doesn't care about him as much as she does the girls.  She abandoned the family about 6 years ago and moved to California. He says his feelings aren't hurt when she bails on his birthday, but you can see it in his eyes that he is.  My son is the coolest kid I've ever met, and I hate her for doing this to him.

Anyone have any ideas for things I can do with him today and this weekend?  I don't have a lot of cash, so... things where we're spending time together are good. We live in the DC area.

He's 12 and likes Warhammer, Minecraft, Call of Duty, etc.  But we do those things together all the time... I guess I'm looking for suggestions for a new experience for him that he'd have happy memories of.

Thanks for your suggestions.


EDIT/UPDATE - Wow... Reddit is an amazing community.  I've literally been fighting back tears while pouring through all of the comments and offers for gifts and amazing things for my son... and while I appreciate it, and I know he would LOVE to have a pile of really awesome things, I have to respectfully decline.  This really all started out as just an appeal for suggestions for cheap stuff that he and I could do this weekend that would be memorable and cool, and I'd worry about him getting the wrong idea about gifts, etc.  I hope no one is offended,  I really... really appreciate everything you're all offering, and it makes me immensely happy to know that I'm a part of this amazing community of people.  

Thank you.

So it's looking like we're going to load a couple of his buddies into the car and go paintballing for the day, followed up by a night out camping!  Thank you all for the suggestions... I'm going to take a lot of pictures and share them after the weekend.

UPDATE 2 - We're back from the trip!  It was awesome.  I posted a follow-up in pics, because... well... I'm sharing pics :)

917,AskReddit,"Japanese culture is widely considered to be pretty bizarre. But what about the other side of the coin? Japanese Redditors, what are some things you consider strange from other cultures?","As an American, I am constantly perplexed by Japanese culture in many ways. I love much of it, but things like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv06_W3Y8qg) are extremely bizarre. Japanese Redditors, what are some things others consider normal but you are utterly confused by?

Edit: For those that are constantly telling me there are no Japanese Redditors, feel free to take a break. It's a niche audience, yes, but keep in mind that many people many have immigrated, and there are some people talking about their experiences while working in largely Japanese companies. We had a rapist thread the other day, I'm pretty sure we have more Japanese Redditors than rapists.

Edit 2: A tl;dr for most of the thread: shoes, why you be wearing them inside? Stop being fat, stop being rude, we have too much open space and rely too much on cars, and we have a disturbing lack of tentacle porn, but that should come as no surprise.

Edit 3: My God, you all hate people who wear shoes indoors (is it only Americans?). Let my give you my personal opinion on the matter. If it's a nice lazy day, and I'm just hanging out in sweatpants, enjoying some down time, I'm not going to wear shoes. However, if I'm dressed up, wearing something presentable, I may, let me repeat, MAY wear shoes. For some reason I just feel better with a complete outfit. Also, my shoes are comfortable, and although I won't lay down or sleep with them on, when I'm just browsing the web or updating this post, I may wear shoes. Also, I keep my shoes clean. If they were dirty, there's no way in hell I'm going to romp around the house in them. Hopefully that helps some of you grasp the concept of shoes indoors."

Reddit, what is something catastrophic that has almost happened to you?","So I was I'd say around 10 years old, and my family decides to take the dog for a walk. I decide I want to rollerblade, and make big circles around my family as they walk. At one point I end up a block ahead of my family, and a rusty beat up truck pulls up and stops, and a dude jumps out. I remember him having a super short beard. 

He says ""hey kid, check this out!"" and he pulls out a skateboard, and rides it on the street and says ""pretty cool skateboard huh kid? You want it?""   I, being completely happy with my roller blades, say ""no thank you!""  He says ""come on! It's free! Just come over here and take it!"" I say ""No, I like my rollerblades!"" 

At this point, he looks down the street and sees my family walking up the street. Without saying anything to me, he throws his skateboard in the back, jumps in his truck and drives away. I never thought it was weird, didn't tell my parents, in my head it was ""some dude tried to give me a skateboard I didn't want!""  10 years later I'm like HOLY FUCK.  THANK GOD I DIDN'T FUCKING LIKE SKATEBOARDS.

tl:dr  Didn't get kidnapped because I thought skateboards suck."

In 2001 I was wrongfully accused of a crime I did not commit by an ex-girlfriend who was very angry with me at the time. As a result I plead ‘no contest’ to a charge that now forces me to register as a sex offender. Nearly 12 years later I cannot find an employer that will hire me because of this.

I'll start.","A few years ago a friend of mine unsuccessfully (thank goodness) tried to kill himself by overdosing on pain pills. He was taken to a small hospital in Millen GA. I was living in Atlanta at the time so some friends as I drove down to check on him. 
When we made it down to the hospital we were asked to wait outside his room while a nurse was in the room attending to our friend. While we were standing in the hall a man dressed in coveralls walked up to us. He was obviously a mechanic by way of the oil stains on his coveralls and the strong smell of grease. We struck up a conversation with him and he told us he’d been down the street at the local mechanic shop (suspicions confirmed!) and he walked down to check on (what I now assumed to be) our mutual friend. He moved to walk into the room and we told him everyone was supposed to wait outside till the nurse was done in the room. “Its okay” he says, pulling a stethoscope out of the pocket of his coveralls “I’m the Doctor”.

TL;DR: Local mechanic is also the Doctor

Reddit what is your most WTF customer service experience?,"So the past weekend we went to a restaurant for dinner with my gf and her friends for her birthday.  We had about 10 people and had about 5 different tabs which all included an 18% minimum tip.  

The service was terrible, the server was incredibly rude and would always response with some kind of sarcasm when we asked questions about the menu.  He took the wrong drink orders twice and blamed us for getting them wrong.  Brought all the apps and entrees at the same time and got upset when we said we didnt want the apps anymore.   My friend payed in cash and when he brought back change, there was no receipt. she was expecting to see 5 bucks and some change back.  When the server came back there was no receipt and only 4 bucks and change there.  She asked him to see the receipt to see if she had miscalculated cause she expected 5 dollars and then some back.  Instead of saying something along the lines of ill go check or something accommodating like that, the dude got irritated and said that he threw away the receipt and reached for his wallet and said ""how about i just give you a dollar if you want it that bad"".

That pissed us all off so we didnt leave any extra tip.  I wrote down ""NOPE!"" on my receipt in the additional tip line.  when i went to use the men's room before leaving, he tapped my shoulder as i was washing my hands and goes.  U think ur pretty funny with that tip dont you?  why dont we step outside so I can show you how funny i can be?

Im like WTF?  called the manager over and told him her server wanted to fight me cause I didnt tip him. explained the whole situation to her while the dude was just eye fucking me the whole time.  other servers had to calm him down cause he kept trying to interrupt me when i was talking to the manager.  I declined all their gift cards cause fuck i dont wanna come back to a place where the staff is gonna shank me.


TL;DR.  Shitty service at restaurant. no tip for server.  dude follows me to the bathroom and wants to fight me to earn that tip.

She came over to tell us.  I was in 7th grade.  My dad refused to believe her and went looking for my mom.  The National Guard was there keeping people away from the worst of the destruction, but after my dad cried and begged on his knees, someone from the Red Cross gave him a little red and white sticker to let him pass.  He found my mom helping with the rescue efforts.

966,AskReddit,Reddit. Would you support being able to access your vote online in order to confirm your vote was not flipped?,"Here is my idea. What if we were able to access our vote online to make sure our vote was counted and counted correctly?

Obviously our votes still need to remain anonymous. So you wouldn't be able to access your vote using information attached to your person such as SSN or your name and birthdate. Instead, when you vote, you are given a sheet of paper with a randomly generated user name and password. When your vote is counted it is uploaded to a government website where you can log in to check that your vote matches the ballot you turned in. You would also be able to check the individual ballots in any county in your state (or maybe nation wide if all states enact it)

There is no danger of the vote being attached to you unless you give that information up (no different than being issued a bank card when you open a bank account) and the transparency makes it difficult to flip votes because if enough people came forward it would warrant an investigation and possibly a redo election. 

What do you guys think?

EDIT: There seems to be a lot of confusion. I'm not suggesting an online vote counting system. Just an online storage system. All votes would be counted the same. They'd just add the vote to the database when they're done counting it.

EDIT2: Thanks for all the upvotes guys. I know this plan isn't perfect but I really think something should be done to make our votes more transparent and less vulnerable to fraud. And discussing it is an important step."

The girls always wanted to know what was going on, and other guys just told them ""you dont want to know.""  Eventually, one of my other friends took a girl in there during the game.  Right as he opened the door, she saw our one friend ""turn"" our other friend into a zombie.  Over her screaming, you can hear they guy yelling, ""IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?! NOW YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO.""  

TL;DR  My friends used to naked wrestle in the showers after gym.

977,AskReddit,Why are comment scores hidden?,"The short answer is [read this](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/).

The long answer is that it was a new feature developed by /u/Deimorz for moderators to implement as a subreddit-wide feature to obscure the vote counts on comments for a predetermined amount of time after their submission.  

The goal of this is to hopefully curtail and minimize the effects of bandwagon voting, both positive and negative.  Highly voted, or lowly voted, comments tend to illicit a knee-jerk vote from people, subconsciously suggesting that the post is better or worse simply because of its score.  We know that's not necessarily the case, but it is true that a top comment after the first hour is likely to remain the top comment for the duration of the post, whether higher quality submissions come in after it or not.

As opposed to 'contest mode' which randomized the sorting and obscured child comments,  hiding the vote score will not affect the sorting and child comments will continue to be displayed as usual. The difference now is net vote difference between submissions will not be visible until the time limit is up, at which point the scores for those comments will appear.  

Ideally this will level the playing field for the first little while of the post few new comments being submitted, and will hopefully discourage piggybacking on top votes for karma or weaker comment making it to the top just because it was there first. Now a comment will more likely be voted on based on its merit and appeal to each user, rather than having its public perception influence its votes.

* Sorting follows how you have it selected (new/controversial/best/top), only the counts are hidden.

* The current time is set for 2 hours, and goes anywhere from 1 minute to 24hours.  It can be tweaked as necessary, which we will likely have to do.

* Unfortunately it's not like the CSS where a user can elect not to apply if if they dislike it, it's a feature of the whole subreddit.

* It is RES-compatible, meaning that even with RES it still obscures the vote count and spread until the time limit is up.

* \*All mobile apps should be effected by in the same way, their display may differ slightly until they catch up to adding a '[score hidden]' type message.

* Bullet point

It'll take some tweaking and refining to get it just right, so we ask for your patience.  Unlike most of the other features,  this one is about as minimally obtrusive as can be. Besides, reddit is supposed to be about the content, not the karma anyways, right?

Any further questions, just ask, and hopefully we'll have answer for you. And keep your eyes peeled in the various 'meta', data-based, and 'theory of' subs, this will likely yield some very interesting studies and posts about the trends observed from this(if you're into that sort of thing)."

981,AskReddit,"Reddit, almost every day some random Haitian couple calls and talks to my two year old giving me time to clean the house, etc. What weirdly awesome random little things are you thankful for? More Details inside.","So 3 months ago we bought a house, and signed up for a for a phone/internet/cable bundle, we didn't need the land-line, but whatevs. Anyways, almost immediately started receiving the typical BS telemarketer calls, cruise offers, collection calls for people previously attached to the numbers, etc. However, everyday around 5 o'clock we started getting phone calls from the same number from either a presumably Haitian man and/or woman who speak absolutely no English as far as I can tell. For about two weeks, I tried to explain to them that Madmwazel Pierre didn't live here, it was the wrong number, but every day they keep calling back. 

One day when they called and I was really busy doing laundry so I just put the phone on speaker and gave it to my 2 year old daughter. She reacted to their voice, and started ""talking"" back babbling, laughing and mimicking them. I went in the other room and came back 10 minutes later and they were still on the phone talking to her. Eventually my daughter mashed enough buttons to hang up the phone. 

The next day, they called back, phone went straight to my daughter... This has been going on for about 2 months now. Some days they listen and talk for 20 minutes, most days its only around 5, but they have talked to her for as much as thirty minutes before. During this time, I am able to load the dishwasher, do laundry, pick up the house and use the bathroom. Stuff that is really hard to do with a very active 2 year old.

I don't know who they are, if they are crazy, lonely, old, or really just don't understand that we have no clue who they are. They could be swearing or doing anything I guess, but they really seem harmless. I have become very thankful for the time they spend talking to my daughter. She even seems to look forward to it too and calls them her ""pals"". 

So Reddit, what weird random things are you thankful for or do you look forward to in your life?

**
TL;DR My daughter has Haitian Phone Babysitters.**

984,AskReddit,I was kicked out of my house for being gay. Im not gay. What should I do?,"**EDIT Theres a couple things I want to say. 1) The ""become gay"" comment? It stopped being funny after about the 50th. 2) FYI My mom isnt religious, this wasnt a Christian thing; it was a ""my moms a bitch"" thing. I used to go to church with my dad, and some Christians are beautiful, amazing people. Some are assholes too though. 3)A couple people have asked what I want to do later in life, and how i plan on going to college. I actually want to go to a military college and then serve our country, like my dad. Most military colleges are, i believe, free or extremely low cost

**EDIT: Putting this edit on the top because I dont think people are reading down to the bottom. IM A GIRL! police talked to my mom, and she's agreed to take me back in. Since my normal home life isn't abusive or anything like that, its doubtful there will be any consequences. CPS is going to be coming in to check on everything for the next couple months. I cant say i'm entirely pleased, but I think it's good for my younger siblings because neither them nor i need to be shoved around in different foster homes and split up. My mom's still not talking to me. Whatever. Shes a bitch anyway. Thanks to everyone who helped. You guys are my true family.**
Also got a lot of questions about my dad: He died last year. He was a decent guy, I dont think this would have happened if he was still alive
Edit: This is probably the worst meme I've ever made, but as requested: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3ooz41/

I was on YouTube last night, and somehow ended up in the section about gays coming out, reactions, etc. Some of them were really touching, and  I ended up watching every single one known to mankind. I went to bed round eleven, forgetting to log out of the computer. Next thing I know, Im being woken up at 3 in the morning. My moms gone through my browser history, seen all these videos, and decided Im trying o figure out how to come out. I'm incredibly disoriented, trying to figure out whats going on, and she's screaming and shouting in my face. She tells me I have to get out now, and not come back until I'm ""fixed"". I've sorta figured out the plot here, and start telling her the truth: I'm not gay. She doesn't believe me, says now I've lied as well as been gay. She calms down enough to a controlled fury, gives me a string bag with a couple days clothing, and tells me she never wants to talk to me again, unless I  ""do something about this."" Its about 7:30 right now, and I'm at my friends house. Im 15 years old, and as much as I hate being in that homophobic environment, I need my mom to provide for me until I can go to college etc. I tried calling her half an hour ago to tell her again, but she just screamed that I was lying. I dont know what to do. My friends going away soon, so I cant stay here. 
PS: this is a throwaway account for privacy reasons, and also my other account is probably still open on my home computer. The one my mom's got access to. Im not looking for karma, just help. 
EDIT: Sorry, should have been clearer. Technically, she thinks i'm a lesbian, since I'm a girl.

EDIT: Thanks everyone who commented helpfully. i have called the police, they will be here in half an hour. After that, I will look into some of the numbers and shelters you guys posted. You all have no idea how helpful you are.


EDIT: Hi guys. The cops came, interviewed me, asked a bunch of questions about normal home life, and what happened. They've gone to my house to bring her into the station. They say it is likely there will be at least some charges, and CPS is being brought. Dont know when I'll next have access to a computer, but thanks to you all. You're the main thing getting me through this.

Anyone have any thing they found out about their parents that makes you want to gouge your eyes out?

TLKDR: My mom sells porn letters to prisoners.

Edit: So y'all are in for a treat. I called my mom and explained to her the post I made. I told her that it quickly recieved over 4,000 comments and she was FLATTERED. She says ""Wait 400 comments? 4,000 COMMENTS? About meeeee?!?!"" So she agreed to do an AMA. It won't be tonight because she has to work, but hopefully tomorrow....she needs to call me back. Anyhow, two things:

1.I'm gonna delete some of my comments so she doesn't get offended and get mad at me. 
2.She doesn't live near me and doesn't have a computer so she's gonna call me and be available for an hour or two. I'll post the time when I verify. However, I know y'all will need verification to know that I'm not lying or making it up. Any ideas for this? A couple ideas we had were taking a picture of her with a letter she wrote and/or a video of me with the phone and her answering the first couple questions. Of course, no faces. What do y'all think?

993,AskReddit,Is it possible that an entire civilization rose and fell without our knowing - sometime during the hundreds of millions of years of prehistory?,"*I do realize that there is no real way of proving this, only that, if there were a civilization of some sort, there would be evidence - probably. But on what part of the world? Could it be a part now covered in ice or water? I think I have wrapped my mind in a knot again.

I know that evidence of some sort would probably exist, but I think of how briefly civilized humans have been around (7000 years, roughly), and then I think about the vastness of prehistory (350+ million years), and it just seems as if entire civilizations could have existed during that time, without our knowing. 

I also remember seeing a History special titled ""Life After Humans,"" and how it showed how quickly plant life and the elements remove all traces of human existence.

Instead of always telling your child (especially toddlers) what to do, give them two choices that provide the same outcome.","We all know kids, especially toddlers, when told what to do often will do the exact opposite or start having a tantrum.  Parents (or anyone who watches a toddler) understand that when you ask a toddler to do the simplest task it can become a major ordeal.  So instead of telling them what to do, give them two options instead.

Children love knowing they have some control over what they are doing. It gives them a chance to use their thinking and reasoning skills in a positive way.  So instead of saying, ""Please put on your pajamas and get ready for bed.""  You could try, ""Which pajamas would you like to wear to bed tonight, your nightgown or your Dora jammies?""

This concept can be used for almost anything.  I started using this approach and it truly was life changing.  It has become second nature and my daughter loves knowing that she is making decisions instead of simply being told what to do.

Edit #1:  Yes, you can do this with adults also.  Thanks for pointing this out.  I use it on my friends and family all of the time. It's great when trying to get a group to decide on a restaurant to eat at. 

Edit #2:  Not all parenting techniques work 100% of the time. What works for one family may not work for another.  There are plenty of comments where people have had success and failures with this method.  If you are a parent or child care giver you learn through trial and error. Good luck to you all.

28,LifeProTips,LPT bounty: 1 year of reddit gold to the first person to provide video proof that airline prices are different in Incognito Mode,"EDIT: **The 24-hour deadline on this bounty has expired. The bounty was not claimed.** My conclusions are:

  1. There were several videos posted that (more or less) tried to follow the protocol. All of them showed the same fare in incognito mode. [One video] (http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/ca1bf28) showed a different fare, due to entering different search parameters (JFK vs NYC). [Another one](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/ca1ng4k) showed a different fare due to mixing up the departure and arrival cities on one of the searches.
  2. It's certainly not as easy as most people say it is. Over 20,000 people voted on this post, and nobody was able to produce a video proving it. Clearly, anyone who says this works a large fraction of the time, or that the effect can be summoned on demand, is wrong.  
  3. Two people *did* manage to get [different results in Kayak](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/ca19wg1). This is not really the LPT we were investigating (in one case it was more expensive in incognito mode, and it's not them charging you more for the same flight). But it's definitely worth looking into. How can you make sure Kayak shows you hacker fares? That would make an excellent LPT.
  4. I'm really comfortable calling this an urban myth until someone can actually show otherwise. Nothing will ever convince certain people, though, so I'm sure we'll see this repeated over and over. Hopefully this test will make people at least think twice before just accepting it uncritically, or accept that it's possible they made a mistake once while entering search parameters.

Many people said there were problems with my protocol. Objections raised include: (1) you need more time to prepare (2) it only works with round-trip flights (3) it doesn't work in the United States (4) the LPT is wrong and you need to clear your cookies instead of going incognito (5) the LPT is wrong and you need to use different computers or IPs.

Here's the thing: I'm not stopping you from making any video you want. I can't _promise_ I'll give gold for it, but if you make video proof, I'm sure the community would love to see it, based on the interest shown here.  Just saying. And I'd be happy to help review your video to give you advice on how to eliminate errors and make sure it actually proves what it's trying to prove.

**Original Post follows:**

[A common LPT](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/13mdr5/lpt_if_you_want_to_buy_the_cheapest_airline/) is that airline prices are different in Incognito Mode. It's true for some online shopping, but I don't believe it's true for flights. I think this is an urban legend. I think that every reported instance is easily explained as [people accidentally entering incorrect search parameters](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1eh2t5/lpt_clear_your_browser_history_and_cookies_or_go/ca091oo), or prices simply changing (as they do) regardless of how you're searching.

I'm looking for someone to prove me wrong. If you're the first to provide _actual video evidence_, I will give you one year of reddit gold. Simply make a video showing it happening, and upload the video to YouTube.

 * Your video must follow my strict protocol (given below). The point of the protocol is to reduce errors and potential for tampering.
 * If you post a video that fails to follow the protocol, you'll be disqualified for 6 hours.
 * If you need the protocol changed, suggest an amendment **before** recording your video. I'll accept reasonable changes, but I will **not** accept any video that fails to follow the protocol as it was written when the video was made.
 * You must post a link to the video in this thread within 3 hours of recording it.
 * This offer is good for 24 hours ~~(but I'll consider extending it if it hasn't been claimed)~~.

Flight search video protocol (version 2):

&gt; You must stick with a single browser and a single flight search website for the entire video.  
&gt; * Acceptable browsers: Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari  
&gt; * Acceptable websites: Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity  
&gt; * Or use the website of one of these airlines: Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, United, USAir

&gt; 1. Open a browser window of the [Times Square webcam](http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/timessquare/). The date and time must be visible. This window must remain visible for the entire video.
&gt; 2. Perform a flight search in a regular browser window.
&gt; 3. Perform the same search in a window in private/incognito mode.
&gt; 4. Perform the same search in a regular window again.

&gt; The windows in steps 2, 3, and 4 must be fully visible while the search is being conducted, until the results appear. You can optionally close the windows from steps 2, 3, and 4 before going on to the next step. You can use the same window for steps 2 and 4. You must not perform any other searches or visit any other web pages during the video.

&gt; Your flight search **must** be for 1 adult, **one-way**, economy/coach class, flight only (no hotels etc.). You can choose any departure city, arrival city, and date, but only one of each: do not select nearby airports, flexible dates, time of departure, or any special options like that. You may perform any searches you want before recording the video, but do not change any settings or preferences on the search website.

&gt; The same flight (same date, time, airline, and flight numbers) must appear in all 3 results, and it must have the same price in steps 2 and 4, and a different price in step 3. The difference in price must be at least $10 USD. Each time, you must clearly show all the search parameters. On the results page, the parameters of the search must be visible.

&gt; Make sure the uploaded video is high enough resolution that the necessary text is readable.

[Here is an example video I made following the protocol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqaKg-eSFdY). Good luck.

PS: Please do not post anecdotal claims here as evidence. I've heard enough of those, and if all you have is a story, there's no way for me to verify you did the search correctly."
29,LifeProTips,LPT: What to look for when buying a used vehicle.,"Mileage doesn't mean much, look at the brake pedal. Cars even with low miles (40,000) and a worn brake pedal pad usually means that car has seen a lot of city (stop and go) driving which is hard on the transmission.

Look at the tires. Worn on edges generally means either worn wheel bearings or bad alignment. BRAND NEW tires is usually a ""quick fix"" for this and masks the problem for a few thousand miles.

Look at the body lines where the doors, hood, and trunk lid meet. The gap should be the same the entire way around. If it is closer or further apart in some areas it usually means the car has been in some accident. Cars from the factory have equal lines.

Look at the paint. It should all be the same color completely all the way around. If it is slightly different shades on panels or in the door jams it usually means body work was done and they did not match the color correctly. Look for bubbles in paint or very small holes in body panels (could be ""tip of iceberg"" for rust and could lead to serious body work shortly down the road).

Inspect the underside of the car. I have personally seen cars with less than 30,000 miles look great around the outside and inside but be rotted and rusted under them due to sitting for long periods of time or road salt in many northern states.

Be wary of later model cars with low miles. 1992 22,000 grandma drove it to the store once a month. Avoid low mile older cars they tend to be very unreliable due to drive-train seals drying out from lack of use.

Test drive the car and drive it harder than you normally would drive it. Accelerate hard and brake hard listen for odd noises coming from engine or transmission, and check for pulsing in brakes or pulling one way or the other on the steering wheel. Lightly hold the steering wheel on a straight section of road. Make sure it doesn't pull to one side or the other and watch it to see if it shakes.

Try all windows, hood release, locks, keys in all doors and trunk. Not hard to change a door or hood for another of same color and most people forget to change the lock cylinder. Another sign it may have had a small accident.

Ask for maintenance log or records of upkeep. Did they change the oil every 3-5,000 miles. Did they buy tires in pairs/sets or single tires at a time (could be sign of alignment problem again)

Look under the hood are there signs of recent cleaning? (not always a bad thing on a overall clean car but many people pressure wash engines that leak oil so they look nice). Pull the engine oil dipstick (is it low on the stick or very high up the stick. Is the oil clean or black like they have not changed it recently). Pull the transmission oil dipstick (only automatics have this generally. The fluid should be a nice red color and shouldn't glimmer like it has glitter in it. smell it YES smell it. It shouldn't smell burnt.) Remove the radiator cap ONLY IF ENGINE IS COLD! Coolant should be either Green, Yellow, or Red depending on type it uses. If it looks like a milkshake that could be headgasket or oil cooler in radiator has failed. level should also be to full mark on overflow tank and near the top on radiator (some cars dont have caps on radiator and only have one on overflow tank.

Check all windows for cracks or chips. Chipped windows can become cracks sometimes and can be pricy if you don't have glass coverage.

Look at dash with key in run position (Not running) and look for check engine light. If light doesnt show at all then it is either burned out or removed. Owner could be hiding a major problem. With car running there should be no dash lights. At most the seatbelt light may be on if you don't have the seatbelt buckled.

Check the heater controls and be sure the positions change as well as the temperature and fan speeds. Does the A/C work? (may seem like it works great on a cooler weather day such as 60 degrees out but really doesn't work well.

Don't always trust them with sayings like ""My mechanic said it just needs a sensor that is $30"". Sure that sounds nice but why didn't they have it fixed if it is a cheap part? Could be that part along with a ton of labor (lots of $$$$) or could be something worse than that part and they are making it sound better. Also be careful if they include the parts needed to fix in the deal. Once again they may know something you don't about fixing that part.

Grab wheels and shake them both at the top and the sides. If you notice something seems loose it could be ball joints, tie rods, or wheel bearings.

One of the biggest things is DO NOT let them tour you around the car until you have looked it over yourself. Also don't be afraid to ask questions about something.

Is it a smoker car or non-smoker. With the heat on in a non smoker car you shouldn't smell any smoke (smoke smell is almost impossible to get out of heater vents). Also look for burns in the seats, carpet, or headliner.

Remove the spare tire from the trunk and look for signs of dampness or rust. When trunk seals go it tends to gather here and rust the trunk floor out.

Be sure to closely inspect cars with aftermarket lights, bumpers, grills, hoods and so on. Aftermarket parts are usually cheaper then OEM parts and could be accident cover up!

Ask when the timing belt has been replaced (applies to cars with timing belts and not timing chains) They have a replacement interval and could fail if not replaced at or close to this mileage. Broken timing belts could cause very expensive engine damage.

Im sure there are many many more things to look for but this is a pretty good list of things I look for when buying cars.

**EDIT: Also Google the vehicle you are going to look at. Many times Google will lead you to sites that tell you common problems with the vehicle. Example: 2003-2006 Ford 6.0L Diesels had many head-gasket problems. You can use this knowledge to see if the owner has had this problem addressed. If not you may be able to talk the price down some to pay for the problem to be fixed.**

**EDIT 2: I see a lot of comments regarding buying from dealers. In a good world yes most people would deal with one. But there are a large group that buys from private people. This post is directed more towards that. Its off figuring you show up to some guys house to look at his car. Although these are also great things to look for anytime you buy a vehicle.**

**EDIT 3: To people saying things such as ""You need to jack it up"" or ""Misaligned panels doesn't always mean accident"". I know I'm saying your driving down the road a private party has a car in their front yard. You stop in to give it a look-over. Here is a list to help you out. This isn't you're a fully prepared mechanic going to look at a vehicle full truck of tools to check everything, or that a door that is a different color means run away screaming. Example: Went to lake for a day fishing. On the way home I see a 2000 Jeep wrangler for sale sign stuck in window. I have zero tools/books/charts with me. Give it a look-over to my checklist above then I can go about deciding if its worth buying (perhaps talking price down if you can) or hoping back in my truck and going on my way.**

Wow this post has way more votes than I thought. This is all for you Redditors. Thank you and good luck with your car buying experiences!"

Protip.  I'm talking about a room full of cigarette or other consumed smoke.  If your house is on fire throw that wet towel over your head and GTFO.  :)

&gt;This works because smoke is a colloid. A colloid ""is a substance microscopically dispersed throughout another substance"". This example of a colloid is a solid suspended in gas. The solid particles in the smoke will stick to the wet portion of the towel therefore eliminating the smoke.

44,LifeProTips,LPT: Bring trick candles with you camping,"Have you ever had trouble lighting a fire (or bbq, or anything) because the wind keeps blowing out your match or lighter? Just bring a couple trick candles with you (the ones that relight themselves after you blow them out). They only take a second to light, and will burn long enough to light your fire. Just pinch it to extinguish.




Edit: Thanks for all the replies! I've noticed from the comments that a lot of people are saying ""if you can light the candle, you can light the fire"", which is a good point.

 However, an advantage to this is that you could hold the candle close to your body, with your back to the wind, and light it easily with your whole body as a wind breaker. Then you can bring it down to your tinder easily, after waiting however long it takes for the trick candle to start working. 

If you try to light the fire right at your tinder, it's often awkward to get your hand in there and you usually just have your other hand to block the wind, or your body from an arms length away. "

It also helps you sound less like a jerk and more like someone who appreciates advice. I've learned that changing just this simple phrase is super helpful in smoothing over social interactions.

If you have decided to attempt keto/become an atheist/start lifting/discover feminism/not to have kids, I would suggest giving yourself some time before making an attempt to announce it to your family and friends. These are the people we tend to alienate the most because they are closest to us. And if you are a minor who is dependent upon your parents, I suggest seriously considering not making an announcement at all unless you are being physically or emotionally harmed.

I know when you discover something you are suddenly passionate about, you want to tell the world about it. It's natural to want so badly to share with those closest to you this exciting new discovery you have made. It has changed your life, and there is a whole new world out there and you want to recruit others to share in it as well because you have found the key to happiness.

I suggest taking some time to learn about this new area you have discovered before you start telling everyone else why they are suddenly wrong or how they are smothering and disrespecting you. Read as much as you can, live your lifestyle for a few months, and see if it becomes just another thing you do or think rather than something you are. Ask yourself why what everyone else is doing is suddenly wrong, what you have to gain by sharing this information about yourself, and if you are bringing something positive to the conversation rather than trying to bring everyone else down.

&gt;keep the inside of your lid CLEAN, use a rage to wipe it off, when paint gets on there it dries, and the cap won't fit on.

&gt;To close it, I apply pressure to 2 opposite sides of the top, then the other sides. Just don't push one side too much.

&gt;After painting many houses, I just put the top on the clean lid, and step on it (I've gotten pretty good at it).


From [kaiserbun](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/14lygs/lpt_once_you_have_tightly_closed_the_lid_on_a_can/c7ejv8x)
&gt;The trick is to use a painters tool, (5 in 1 tool), and work your way around the can evenly. Next best thing is a paint can opener or key that has the proper angled end. The worst thing you can do is try an open a can with a flat head screwdriver especially an old can. In that case you'd be better off using a knife like Crocodile Dundee."

Other things you can do is to move your router away from other  sources of interference  such as phones, wiring and microwaves.

From my own experience, it's all about giving yourself the right habits:

* Stop drinking caffeine.  Cut it out entirely.  Take aspirin for the couple days of headaches.  Then when you need it once a month, it will actually be a boost instead of ""reset to not drowsy"".  Even then, take it (small quantities: tea not soda) in the morning, never in the evening (it has a **half** life of around 5 hours).
* Stop making up lost sleep on the weekends, by getting more sleep on the weekdays.  Make a schedule and stick to it.  Do you need 8 hours of sleep to function?  Do you take an hour to fall asleep?  Do you need to be up at 7AM?  Aim to go to bed at 10PM, every single night of the week.  Are you an insomniac who needs 2 hours to fall asleep but only 4 hours of actual sleep to function?  Fine!  Plan for six (but seriously consider meditation classes for while you're waiting to fall asleep).  You can adjust this as you go but force yourself to lie in bed at that time for a couple weeks until you're used to it.  If your schedule won't allow this much time set aside for sleep, re-evaluate your life (I used to be an MMORPG addict and now regularly go weeks without playing a game).
* Stop snoozing / setting multiple alarms.  Snooze sleep is not worthy sleep.  Set your alarm for the last possible time you can get up (I don't mean like ""not even time to shower"" but the last possible time to do your entire morning routine with a little urgency).  Then train yourself to get up as soon as it goes off.
* Regular exercise (any kind of exertion; walking a few miles a day totally counts) is really important, you're not going to sleep well after an all-day movie/gaming marathon.
* Light can be more powerful (but shorter lasting) at keeping you awake than caffeine.  In the morning get that awakeness you lost giving up caffeine by opening the windows and letting the sun shine in.  But you also need to give yourself a sense when it's getting dark so your body can wind down.  Dimmers are cheap and easy to install.  Make sure your alarm clock isn't a beacon of light.  Put sticky notes over it if you have to dim it, you shouldn't be able to read it well in daytime.  I use a projection clock because I sleep with my head facing up and I don't have to move (or mentally wake up) much to read the time from the ceiling at night (it's unreadable with the bedroom light on).
* Oh it's an hour before bed-time and it takes 45 to 90 minutes to play a round of a video game?  NO.  BAD.  Even at 45 minutes that's a lot of light in your face right before bed.  Honestly you're better off spending that last hour with some human contact (in a low light area) or (at least for me with some self control) on reddit with the enhancement suite's dark background on.
* When you do wake up in the middle of the night, keep it simple so you don't ""rev up"" your brain to full awakeness.  A bathroom nightlight is good, depending on your vision you may need to tape it darker.
* The bed is for sleeping and sex, nothing else.  Pull the reading light and TV out of the bedroom.  For that matter, I try to get my sex done in the mornings or day time so she's not pining for it when I'm trying to sleep.  Back to the light thing, I bought blackout curtains and keep mine as dark as possible.
* Dunno about diet though I generally don't worry about mine.  Do you wake up hungry and then can't fall back asleep?  Eat more non-sugary foods before bed (okay maybe not *right* before bed but soon enough).  Capping the night with a small sugary food can be a digestive aid, but I mean like **one** cookie.
* I found myself futily waking up many nights because I was too warm.  I then read somewhere that your body temperature naturally goes up at a certain point in your sleep.  I bought a programmable thermostat for my central A/C in the summer (apologies if you don't have this option), and set it to go down two degrees at approximately 2.5 hours before I planned on waking up.  It makes a huge difference.
* Establish boundaries with your bed-mates.  If they are disruptive, you can tell pets what to do by locking them out.  Humans require a little more negotiation.  Let your partner know when you are getting ready for bed ""I'm brushing my teeth now"" and encourage them to get their pajamas out of the bedroom because you're going to sleep soon and don't want them to have to turn on the light.  Over time if you're consistent, your partner will probably end up in bed 5 minutes after you most nights anyway.  Noisy neighbors?  Get a pack of earplugs and learn how to properly insert them.
* Don't ever use any kind of drug to help yourself sleep.  Count your alcoholic drinks and switch to water at the appropriate amount of time before your planned bed time.  Think of it like planning to have your hangover as you're falling asleep, and then it never comes.  ""Passed out"" is never the same as ""asleep"".

Do most of this and you'll find yourself calmly waking up just before your alarm, consistently.  It's what works for me, I'm not trying to be demanding I just try to consider them absolute rules *to myself*.  They switched me from a ""night person"" to a ""morning person""."

87,LifeProTips,Use Socratic questioning as a way to defend your position/win arguments/get people to see things from your perspective,"You know how teachers have that annoying habit of asking lots of questions? *Why do you think this is? How do you think he felt?* etc.

It's actually a method of teaching and a very effective way of winning arguments against the unsuspecting. For example, let's say your girlfriend is angry about you coming home late one night. She says, *You didn't call me! I was so worried, and you were probably out at the bar hitting on girls!*

You could respond, *No baby, I wasn't, I swear.* But effectively this is two heads butting; the one with greater force wins.

Instead, ask questions. This puts you in a position of control without being aggressive, and forces the listener to accept their own hypocrisy/flawed reasoning.

Say something like: *Why are you upset? What do you think I was doing? Is it that I'm late that bothers you, or that you can't trust me?*

Rather than arguing back and forth, you're encouraging her to express how she feels, and it seems like you're making an effort to listen. Eventually she'll either forgive you, or you'll see that you were wrong, or she'll see that she was being unreasonable.

I gave a very sexist example, but this works for heated debates as well. Rather than saying, *Animals aren't meant to be in captivity,* say, *Do you think animals were meant to be in captivity?* Wording your point of view in the form of a question forces them to see it from your perspective whether they like it or not, because a question psychologically puts them in a position where they have to answer it.

Also useful when teaching your kid. Instead of just explaining how the world works, arrange your questions as a guide for your child to figure it out on their own. Questions are powerful, powerful things when used correctly. Takes a bit of effort to think them through, but after a bit of practice, it becomes second-nature. Just don't overdo it.

**edit: blablabla, front page, wasn't expecting this. My example wasn't very good -- use the questions sparingly and at the appropriate time, as many comments below have pointed out. Obviously answering *everything* with a question will result in a redditor punching you in the face.  Thank you for reading, I'm Ron Burgundy?**"

93,LifeProTips,Learn to use spices by cooking them one at a time with white rice to become familiar with their flavor and intensity.,"Learn what various spices taste like and how strong they are by cooking them one at a time with plain white rice. Use one teaspoon spice (e.g. basil, cumin, ground ginger) per cup of rice and cook per directions. This will give you a basic education to begin creating your own dishes, or the knowhow to discuss dishes knowledgably with others. Later, try combining two or more with rice to see what works together and what doesn't."

We CAN flash our lights, but often times it goes unnoticed. I personally use signals because flashing your brights at people is illegal in the state that I live and I have an irrational fear of flashing my lights at another cop. Tapping the top of your head, of course, is not illegal as far as I know."
96,LifeProTips,Some quick office pro tips,"* When you have chit chtters that eat away at your day, best polite thing to do is walk to their office. Engage as much or as little as you want, naturally they will follow you. Once you get into their office, they will sit down. It's damn instinctual. Then say goodbye and go back to yours, works every time.

* If you have a micromanaging type boss, they tend to enjoy the feeling of control more than the understanding that it undermines morale and can build resentment. Get to know his habits. e.g. If he comes into your office 3 times a day to get an in depth look at what you are doing, plus details, take charge.

    Note what time he does this in a day, enter his office 10 min prior on a regular basis. flood him with the details... Don't BS him, but flood him with details that a supervisor shouldn't need to know. You'll accomplish two thinigs.

    you are signalling you know your job and are in control, you established his office as the place to discuss workload, and yours as a place to get things done. He won't bother you, since it's pointless to get a rehash of what you've already gone into. If you get visits later in the day, just reiterate he knows the plan, and you will see him when complete. Also, above tip helps with this.

* Finally, if you tend to be a burst worker ( lots of work, plenty of brakes, but down time often in between) and have bossess or coworkers who still believe that lookin busy = getting more done, then leave the office. Hell, I've gone so far as to go to starbucks to have some down time during lunch hours. If they want to establish that every second in your chair should be 100% productive, even with you meeting deadlines well, then being absent is the only way to allieviate that. If you have nowhere to go, even a couple minutes in the bathroom with your cell phone if you have to. It gets your mind out of that mindset, will probably increase productivity, and keep everything on the up and up. Last thing you need is the fight where you have to show you are getting results from a position of defending yourself."
100,LifeProTips,LPT: 4 Simple ways to identify a potential stroke victim. This could help save someones life.,"Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. The stroke victim may suffer *severe brain damage* when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.

You see a lot of ads like this on craigslist, promising 50k salaries, entry level training, no experience required, for something called ""Outsourced Marketing"" or ""Direct Marketing."" Links like these tend to proliferate on craigslist. When I went to write this post, I figured I would have to do some searching to find them. Turns out, there were multiple ones posted in the last week. 

http://newjersey.craigslist.org/mar/3788629725.html

Here's a paragraph about what one of these companies says they do:

""At LIFE Long Island, our marketing services provide our various clients with the ability to reach out to thousands of potential customers and consumers on a daily basis. In a marketplace full of generic advertising and increased competition, LIFE Long Island is able to interact and build relationships with the people that matter when our competitors flyers and direct mail is sitting in the trash.

LIFE Long Island has had incredible success with its current and past clients employing a business to business marketing plan in many industries including telecommunications, office supplies, retail solutions, and merchant processing. Our account managers are professional, knowledgeable, and adaptable to the changing needs of today's small and medium sized businesses. We utilize a strong marketing system while integrating a personable approach to make sure to satisfy the needs of the business owner as well as the client we are representing.""

You may have noticed that a lot of proffesional sounding buzzwords later, you still don't actually have a clear picture of what they do? Because they're intentionally trying to hide what they actually do. 

Door to door sales. 

The company I got an interview with, Life Long Island in Mineola, NY, does door to door office supplies sales. They order supplies cheaply off amazon, and then send their door to door salesmen to resell them to offices, advertising it more cheaply than if they ordered from Staples or Office Maxx. 

These salesmen get paid on commision, pay for their own gas and tolls, and will be expected to go on an all day, unpaid ""Second Interview"" that's basically a day's work for no money. Secondly, many of these companies don't actually pay commission to their employees, but screw them out of it. Life Long Island, apparently, paid someone who posted on Ripoff Report 130 a week, even after he made quite a bit in commision. 

Because of these practices, there's an incredibly high rate of turnover. Many employees leave, which is why their HR representatives are so aggressive during interviews. When you go on an interview, no matter what, you will be a strong candidate. For your second interview, you're told to wear comfortable shoes. Odd? Because you'll have to walk around all day, following door to door salesmen. 

Now, full disclosure, I haven't worked at one of these companies. I got an interview at one, was informed what they really do, and then promptly backed out. The next week, a friend of mine got an interview at a different ""Direct Marketing"" company with a suspicious website, and we proceeded to maybe read every single piece of info in existence on this. 

Many of them are pyramid scheme type places that are affiliated with Cydcor. They tend to train people how to set up their own ""Marketing"" companies that do the same thing. But there's a massive amount of turnover due to the shitty practices, and multiple companies, such as Limitless Marketing and Life Long Island, have had to change their names when they get in trouble with the state. 

I see posts on Craigslist ALL THE TIME for companies like these, so I figured I'd kick it over to you guys. If anyone has a good experience at a ""Direct Marketing"" or ""Outsourced Marketing"" company like this (not an actual, legitimate marketing company), then please, correct me, because every single thing I've read about this has been awful. 

TLDR: Entry Level ""Direct Marketing"" and ""Outsourced Marketing"" is a scam. It's door to door sales.

&gt;Me: Want to grab some Pizza?

&gt;Her: I don't care.

&gt;Me: What about burgers?

&gt;Her: I don't care.

Instead of this happening, you institute the veto rule, which means that **anyone who vetoes a suggestion has to pay for that veto with a suggestion of their own**. This keeps it from becoming lopsided.

**WITH** the veto rule:

&gt;Me: Want to grab some Pizza?

&gt;Her: Nah. Chicken Tenders?

**Edit:** since this blew up, I'll mention something many commenters have as well: 

The **Pick Three Rule** (or 5-3-1 or some other variation). 

Someone suggests 2-5 options, the other vetoes some of them, and the original person chooses from the survivors. 

*Optional rule:* if the second person vetoes all suggestions, they must re-suggest an equal number of options in return.

Also, here's how you can make the ramen variation I mentioned:

1. Put a bit less than 2 cups of water in a pot and boil it. 
2. Add ramen. Fuck the little packet of powder, you can toss that. 
3. Set timer to 3:33 for the noodles (it's quick to enter on the microwave). The next few steps are done while the noodles cook. 
4. Prepare eggs and sauce. Crack 2-3 eggs in a bowl. Leave them alone. 
5. Put a dollop (trial and error for amount) of peanut butter in another bowl--the one you'll eventually eat out of--and cover that shit with sriracha sauce. Mix it up with a fork, and you should have a nice paste (not too thick). Start with a little bit of peanut butter and a little sriracha; you can always add more of both, but you can't take it away. 
6. Noodles are done. **Leave the heat on high.** 
7. Add eggs, one at a time, stirring them into the noodles. Once it starts to ""boil"" again, add another egg. 
8. Finish cooking until eggs look done (1-2 min. maximum).
9. [Optional] drain remaining water. I don't like soupy ramen, but this is up to you.
10. Add egg noodle stuff to the bowl of spicy peanut paste. Stir, add more sriracha to taste, and enjoy this delicious meal. 

Total prep time is about 10 min, which includes cleaning up after. "

But a lot of times when we have been out trying to have a nice romantic evening we end up discussing how the kids are doing at school, or plans for house repairs or whether we should save more for retirement, etc. Not very romantic, right?

And yet, when you're living with someone, especially in a long term relationship, there are a lot of ""business"" items which do need to be discussed. The solution we've found is to have coffee and/or breakfast once a week during which time we discuss those kinds of things. Breakfast is a good time of day because you are fresh, presumably are fully sober and have the whole day ahead of you to accomplish stuff. Extra points if you make it a nice breakfast with pancakes, bagels or whatever.

In addition, if you make the business breakfast a time when you can bring up petty grievances, it really can reduce snarking at each other during the week. Instead of having to confront your SO over some little thing when it occurs to you, you can have time to frame your requests in a more productive manner. 

For example, you might want to ask your husband to be more helpful with the laundry. Instead of seeing the laundry piled up and automatically reacting with ""How come you never help me with laundry?!"" you might instead wait until your weekly breakfast and say ""You know, it would be really helpful if you could put start a load of laundry before you go to work in the mornings.""

Knowing in advance that you will have time to discuss the ""business"" of marriage / living together really reduces stress on your relationship!"

Basically, you shouldn't tell people your goals because 

* subconsciously: proclaiming a goal makes your brain think you've already completed it, giving you a sense of satisfaction without actually doing any of the work
* consciously: you think you've already made a step towards your goal, allows you to procrastinate more

155,LifeProTips,LPT: A few things mechanics value over all else when it comes to their customers.,"As a former mechanic, here are some repair shop tips:

If you don't know what you're talking about, don't try to pretend that you do. We'll know. 

If you **do** know what you're talking about, don't talk our ears off, and don't stalk our bay like a vulture. Use your knowledge to tell us exactly what we need to know, stand back, and let us do our job. I'm not saying you shouldn't keep a watchful eye on your technician if you have the ability to do so, I'm just saying that you shouldn't hang over their shoulders trying to, for lack of a better phrase, ""talk shop"" with them. 9 times out of 10, as long as the shop doesn't have a rule against it, if you ask if you can watch and promise to be quiet, mechanics will gladly let you. Gaining their permission to do so is generally a solid indicator of how confident the shop is in their work, but turning you down does **not**, on its own, mean they're running a shady operation. Shops are dangerous as all hell, and something bad can happen before you even realize it.

**Call us out**. If for any reason you aren't comfortable with what we're telling you needs to be done, ask us to show you exactly what we're talking about. Trustworthy mechanics will practically fall over themselves to give you proof to back up what they're saying, because earning your trust is their top priority. They will also be **extremely** hesitant to do any work before they're 100% sure you understand what they're talking about. The shops you need to stay away from will fight you tooth and nail, and will do everything in their power to divert you away from their bullshit (and, in some extreme cases, will actively push you to authorize the work knowing full well you have no clue what they're telling you.)

Nearly every mechanic out there has an eidetic memory when it comes to cars and their owners. If you treat us like trash even when we're being patient and polite, we **will** remember. That goes the other way as well; if you're nice to us, we'll go out of our way to ensure your next experience is as smooth as possible, and if we're allowed to, will often give you a small discount.

There are **very** few truly shady shops out there. From my experience, most of the places that seem like they're trying to rip you off are actually just piss-poor operations that don't have people skilled in the delicate art of customer service. No time are people more testy and more defensive than they are with their vehicles. Combine that with a general lack of customer service, and honest ignorance can easily look like a willful act of fraud. That said, trusting mechanics with the life of you and your family yet treating them all like moronic swindlers is not a polite thing to do. Assume that they **are** trustworthy, until they give you a reason to believe otherwise.

With that in mind, you know how I said that we remember if you're a jerk or not? Shady places also remember if you're gullible or not. They'll essentially outright lie to you, and if you buy what they're selling, shablam...they've got a stooge for life. Given the nature of shady shops, they don't require a large number of customers, just a cadre of very gullible ones. As other posters have mentioned in the comments though, it's extremely rare to find a shady person working in an otherwise squeaky-clean shop, as they get run out pretty quickly. As a general rule, either the whole shop is crooked, or the whole shop is on the up and up.

Very unfortunately, the stereotype that women often get higher bills than men is true to some extent, but it's not due to sexism or anything like that. In general, women are more willing to get work done on their vehicles precisely because they don't understand what is being told to them (I know there are some incredibly kick-ass female technicians out there, but generally, this is the case.) As a result, women are given bigger writeups/less discounts in the hopes that they'll just say ""screw it"" and agree to have things done. Highly reputable shops will **never** do this, but even relatively decent ones sometimes will. It's an unfortunate pock mark on the industry.

A shop that has a competent, well-liked shop foreman is likely to be a competent, well-run shop. Just like a head chef does far more than just cook, a shop foreman is responsible for things like inventory, customer service issues, and in really smartly run places, things like ticket allocation for specific repair needs. For example, if Josh can do magical things with a welder and a Huth pipe bender, and Arnie can properly align the rear camber of a riced-out Civic, it doesn't make any sense for Arnie to break out the Bend Cards and for Josh to struggle with the Civic just because of the ticket order. I know that's getting into the nitty-gritty details of things, but the point is that a skilled foreman (**with both cars AND people**) usually means a solid operation.

People are often miffed about going in for a simple oil change, and then leaving with a $1000 estimate for a bunch of work on their car that they might not necessarily need right then and there. It's important to remember that an estimate is exactly that: an estimate. It's just a way of informing you of things they found wrong (or things that could *potentially* be wrong.) Why would they look if they're just doing a simple oil change, and why would they mention something if you don't actually need it yet? Well, say something looks like there's even a 10% chance of being bad (or going bad in the near future), and a shop doesn't tell you about it, and then two days later it breaks. Who are you likely to blame: the car, or the shop you just went to? Liability and ass-coverage is the name of the game, dear poster. I assure you that their goal isn't to piss you off. Most of the reputable places will wince at doing it, but will still do it all the same. 

If you want to give your mechanic a little treat (which, just like a customer's attitude, is something mechanics ALWAYS remember), any kind of food or drink that fits with the time of year is a solid bet. Soup, coffee, etc in the winter, or super-cold drinks or sandwiches in the summer. Something that isn't too sugary or soda-like is actually preferred...they might tell you they would prefer soda, but trust me, they don't. Hydration is what they want. Mechanics are also known to be fond of gifted six-packs, regardless of the weather :)

There are many issues that can honestly seem like they're coming from one part in the vehicle, when in fact they're coming from a different part. Some of us refer to these issues as ""phantom problems"", although I've always been partial to the phrase ""ventriloquist bastard"".

Here's a basic example: your check engine light comes on. You take it to the shop, they hook up an OBD2 scanner to it, and the code says that your downstream O2 sensor is bad. The mechanic replaces the sensor, and sends you on your way. Three days later, the light comes back on, and the same code is tripped. Turns out that, yes, the sensor was indeed bad, but so was your catalytic converter. Since the sensor was downstream of the converter, it's the **converter** that caused the **sensor** to fail in the first place. The sensor was indeed bad and needed to be changed, but that wasn't necessarily the root cause of the problem.

This doesn't mean the mechanic is dumb or bad at their job! It just means they might not have a lot of experience, or they might not have ever encountered a converter fouling out a downstream oxygen sensor. Remember, cars are insanely complicated, and there are a near infinite number of things that can go wrong. Everyone screws up sometimes.

It's also important to remember that being a mechanic is **brutal**. This can vary depending what shop you work in, but we're talking temps in the winter so cold you can't even hold on to your tools, and then in the summer temps so hot you can drink 2 gallons of water a day and STILL be dehydrated at the end of it all. Even if you work in an air conditioned/heated shop, you're still essentially weight-lifting and doing cardio for 8-12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week.

It's a very tough but very rewarding job. Knowing that someone is able to get their kid to daycare and then get to their job safely all because of the work that **you personally do** is immensely satisfying. Likewise, every mistake you make has high visibility on it, so the job requires you to be very humble and to quickly grok what you did wrong. Making a mistake happens to everyone, but all good mechanics never make the same mistake twice.

4) Stop backing up as soon **as you can no longer see the car parked in the space behind you** in your right mirror.

5) straighten the wheel out and back **straight back** until the front of your car can clear the back bumper of the front car.

I tried for years to help them by installing and instructing them on the use of Spybot and various virus blockers, but it never seemed to do any good. Then, just for the heck of it, I installed Adblock on the main family computer a few years ago. Maybe it's just my family, but evidently 90% of the problems they had were caused by ads, presumably the kind that look like Windows messages telling you to install something.

Just as a disclaimer, I do feel a little bad about this. I understand that spreading Adblock around probably hurts content creators. There's a whole debate to be had about that, but I'll leave you to consider that for yourself. If it really bothers you, you could disable Adblock for the pages that they visit that aren't covered in malicious garbage.

As a side note, if they ask you what laptop they should buy, recommend a Mac. I personally don't like using Macs that much, but they're perfect for people who can't figure out how to not get ridiculous virus infections all the time.

180,LifeProTips,LPT: How to interview well.,"I work in technology and have been part of the interview process at my last few jobs. I also recently switched jobs and did a substantial amount of interviewing. I received numerous offers before I accepted my current position. 

Every now and then I see some advice about interviewing on this sub that I find questionable, so I decided to share what I consider to be my interview bag of tricks.


* Look put together. 

Ask your recruiter/HR contact what the dress code is during the phone screen or in-person interview scheduling process. If he or she says business casual, wear nicely ironed slacks, an ironed dress shirt, and dress shoes. Dress code is highly debate and some interviewees say ""If I can't wear a t-shirt to the interview, I won't be a cultural fit!"" - great, this tip is how to get a job, not how to avoid getting one. If you must look ""casual"" without asking about the dress code, at least wear a polo.

Being put together is more than dress code, though. Go to Target and get a $10 faux leather folio and ditch the 5 star notebook look. Get a pen that looks nicer than a $.25 bic. Keep extra copies of your resume in the folio along with paper to jot down notes during the interview.

* Be memorable

This means that they should think you're a good dude or dudette from the beginning. As soon as anyone walks into the interview room, immediately stand up and offer a hand shake and introduce yourself. Don't wait for them to introduce. You're the one trying to look personable and make a good impression.

This also means that you should do things like asking ""What would my typical day/week look like in this position?"" or ""How many members would be on my team and can I meet any of them?"" This gives you a glimpse of the actual job itself, while making them think about situations where you're in the job. This is good.

* Don't be bashful.

Interviews are not a time to be humble. You need to outperform every single other person that's interviewing. If someone asks, ""have you worked with X"" and you haven't, the correct answer isn't ""No, I haven't,"" it is ""I've worked with Y extensively and I've been dying to get my hands on X. I know that a lot of skills overlap between the two, but I haven't had a chance to use X yet. I've kept up on it and my strong background in Y makes me confident I'd pick up on X quickly.""

* Do some research about the company beforehand.

Walking in knowing that they just landed a huge customer or moved to a new office building gives you a talking point if there is any downtime in the interview, or gives you questions to ask at the end of the interview. It makes you look interested and prepared. It's also OK to look people up on LinkedIn, if you know who will be interviewing you.

* Always have questions.

No job is ever how it's presented during the interview. You need to make sure that it's a good fit for you. Yes, the economy sucks, but if you're lucky enough to be in a position where you don't *need* the first offer that comes across the table, then you should be vetting them as much as they are vetting you. Things like ""On the way out, could you show my where my work area would be?"" or ""Can I meet any members of the team?"" or even ""How long have the most senior and most junior members of my team been here?"" will all give insight into the conditions/culture. You want to avoid high turnover, but you also want to avoid lifers and a team of geriatrics if you're a younger up-and-comer.


I hope this helps, reddit. That whole ""ask what concerns them about you"" LPT from last week really grinded my gears and I felt like I needed to counterbalance it with some actual useful information."
181,LifeProTips,"LPT: Need to know if a woman is just big or pregnant? Just ask,"" Do you have any kids?"". This has given me the answer 95% of the time.","I always tell people if they really need to know just ask,"" Do you have any kids?"". If she's pregnant the answer will always almost be along the lines of ""Oh not yet, but I'm expecting""...""I already have x kids and another one one the way."" If she just answers no then don't ever bring it up.  
Honestly though, if you don't NEED to know I wouldn't ask unless you know for a fact they won't be insulted.  
Personally, I wouldn't care if someone asked me straight out."
183,LifeProTips,LPT: Switch to bamboo pillowcases/sheets if you like cooler temperatures (colder pillowcases!) Bamboo blends are a more breathable resulting in 2-3 degrees colder than other sheets.,"My boyfriend would always rave about how much he liked the cold side of the bed (and would often take the cool parts I didn't get to yet when we cuddled in bed together).  I looked into new bedsheets and found out that bamboo blends (rayon from bamboo) are more breathable and wicks away moisture allowing for a cooler feel.

Bought them for him and he absolutely loves them. Keeps his pillowcase nice and cool too, moreso than the pillowcases he had before.

Definitely would recommend if you are a fan of cold bedsheets and/or you suffer from hotflashes when sleeping."
186,LifeProTips,LPT: Your lectures recorded? Download VLC media player and watch it at 1.4x speed to save TONS of time.,"Watching lectures to study is a great way to freshen yourself up for an exam or even to cram. However, it can take hours and hours. You can cut a huge chunk of the time by watching it in an increased speed.
 
At first it will sound funny / ~~high pitched~~ but after 1-2 minutes you will stop noticing and you will get used to the sound. Also you can process information a lot faster when comprehending than trying to articulate lecture material so it shouldn't be too fast. 1.3~1.4X works best for me.

Edit: 

* VLC is a media player that I use and am comfortable with, to all the naysayers I'm sorry I suggested a product that I use but it works. 

* I use voice recorder application on my smart phone for classes which don't have the luxury of recording class. 

* strikethrough on ""high-pitched""

    * A summary of the research paper by /u/Exaskryz : I just looked at it, and here's a summary from the conclusion (not the abstract):

        * Multimedia principle - giving multiple representations that build off of each other is better than just one representation.  
        * Redundancy inhibts learning. That is, just reading aloud text and displaying it (powerpoints, handouts, etc.) inhibits learning.  
        * You can replay *video* lecture material at up to 1.33x speed and get the same learning benefit. Video may be just a powerpoint with changing pictures that supports the audio.  
        * Audio only lectures at 1.33x speed hinder high level learning (their example of high level is problem solving). If the audio lecture is part of a multimedia environment, it's OK though.  
        * A multimedia environment is defined: ""verbal (text or narration) and non-verbal (images or icons)"" 

            
* People curious of what I study, I'm a Neuroscience Major at the University of MIchigan. I would ask kindly to not ""bash"" other people's fields of study just because you feel that yours is more difficult. Information is information and this tip can be applied very broadly.

192,LifeProTips,"LPT: As a science/math major, this is how I improved my college essays using 5 formulas.","**INTRO EDIT**: WOW I didn't think this would take off so much.  Thanks for the upvotes and the comments.  Just a quick clarification as I read the comments:  the intended audience for this LPT is college undergraduates.  If you are a college student trying to improve your B's to A's, these tips may help you.  If you are an aspiring New Yorker contributor, accomplished editor, or a grammarian, please refer to the comments on the finer points of the word ""however,"" the nuanced use of the semicolon, and the difference between a present participle and a gerund.

I am not a writer or editor. I am a science/math person who struggled with writing in college.  I used the following formulas to improve my essay grades.

Note: I am skipping the usual advice on proofreading, organization, creating a thesis, etc.

A. **Transitions.** Use liberally.  They add fluidity to papers and make you sound less robotic.  Examples include furthermore, therefore, however, in addition, in contrast, and moreover.  Look up more examples.  There are two general formulas to use transitions.  TRANSITION + COMMA + CLAUSE.  SUBJECT + COMMA + TRANSITION + COMMA + PREDICATE.

* ex: Medieval art is characterized by the depiction of religious figures.  **In addition,** art from this period includes the use of precious metals such as gold.

* ex: Ukarine does not have any natural environmental hazards.  The **country, however, experienced** an environmental catastrophe following the Chernobyl disater in 1986.

**EDIT:** Some comments below have brought to my attention that [it may be bad style to start a sentence with ""however"" though it is grammatically correct.](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/starting-a-sentence-with-however.aspx)

B. **The semicolon.** Considered the ""cherry on top"" that adds sophistication to a paper.  Use sparingly.  Too often, this punctuation is abused because students needlessly replace a period between two related independent clauses with a semicolon.  DO NOT DO THIS.  My suggestion is to use the semicolon with transitions with the following formula.  CLAUSE 1 + SEMICOLON + TRANSITION + COMMA + CLAUSE 2.

* ex: Heroin is a prodrug that metabolizes into **morphine; therefore,** it has the same effects on the CNS as other opioids.

* ex: Researchers have found that playing violent video games does not cause violent **behavior; on the contrary,** many recent papers suggest violent video games reduce bullying in adolescents.

C. **Not only this, but also that.**  Another winning formula. This should be used as a topic sentence to transition from one topic to another.  Let's say you're writing a paper on the health benefits of exercise.  Your first paragraph is about how exercise improves cardiovascular health.  Your second paragraph is about how exercise has pyschological benefits.  Your topic sentence for your second paragraph can be constructed like this:

* ex: **Not only** does regular exercise prevent cardiovascular disease, **but** research has **also** linked exercise with psychological benefits.

Don't forget the ""also.""  Common mistake.

D. **Show.**  Use words like show, demonstrate, and indicate to link ideas together in a conclusive way.  This is also a great way to link evidence to commentary or fact with opinion.  It demonstrates logical thinking.  The formula is EVIDENCE + ""SHOW"" + COMMENTARY.

* ex: The rise in teenage pregnancy in communities that have banned contraceptive education **demonstrates** that abstinence only sex education has no place in the classroom.

If you want to highlight a point or argument, use words like highlight, underline, and underscore.

If the evidence does not directly show a conclusion or the evidence is weak (e.g. a correlation), use words like suggest, imply, and implicate.

E. **The gerund.**  The gerund helps link two ideas in a single sentence.  It also helps vary sentence length and structure.  Again, it adds sophistication and fluidity to a paper.  ""Gerunding"" is best used with tip #4, which basically converts *show* into *show-ing*.  The basic formula is CLAUSE 1 + GERUND + CLAUSE 2.

* ex: Thoreau's ""Civil Disobedience"" describes the military as ""small movable forts and magazines"" **suggesting** that soldiers are mindless drones taking orders from a corrupt government.

**EDIT**: As some redditors have pointed out, this is actually a participle and not a gerund.  I learned some of the finer points of English today."
194,LifeProTips,LPT: Awkward with kids? Here are some tips.,"I hang out with children for a living and thought I would share some basic tips for interacting with kids. This post mainly pertains to kids 3-10, but can be adjusted as needed. Also this list is for casual/familial contact with children, think meeting a girlfriends kids or thanksgiving with your cousins. 

1. After being introduced or asking their name remember it. Pretty basic right? Who doesn't feel valued when a new friend (and that's what you're doing, making a new friend) remembers your name? But you would be surprised how many times a child gets introduced as ""Nancy's boy"" or ""Tom's girlfriends daughter"". 

If for some reason you are introducing them to someone new say this is my friend ""insert name"". Is it cheesy? Maybe, but I haven't meet a child who minds and it's sweet when they introduce me to their friends the same way.

2. Boundaries. They are important, especially with kids. Don't want to be ""Uncle Jimmy who wrestles"", Then don't start. Horse play around with them once and you will be asked to do it every time. Not that wrestling is a bad but expect two things a) The parents will most likely hate it,  not because they think it is creepy but they don't want them to bug you.  b) You will hurt them. If I had a dime for every child that got hit by a rogue elbow or slipped from my grasp I would have two dimes.... Two very sad dimes.

3. Don't ask them about school. They like it ""okay"" and their favorite subject is recess.  There are a couple exceptions a)  If they bring it up and b) If you know a child of similar age/grade/teacher that they may know. 

4. So what do you talk about? Just like talking with an adult try and find similar interests. Sports, dance class and movies are all good starting points. And depending on the age, your profound knowledge of Spongbob and Adventure Time could come in handy. 

5. Learn a skill (also known as a kid friendly party trick). I have two card tricks and know how to make three kinds of paper airplanes  (simple enough to make in under a minute but complex enough to impress) up my sleeve at all times. 

6. Take the heat. Getting too loud? Paper airplane hit someone in the head? Take the fall, apologize and move on. Remember what it feels like to always get in trouble?  Misspeak? Admit it immediately without saying things like ""like you never make mistakes"" or ""you say stuff wrong all the time"". Adults admitting they are wrong are few and far between and doing so garners instant respect. 

7. Don't be condescending. The only thing that separates them from adults is a little bit of time and experience. Don't make the mistake of thinking you're more intelligent than them, you're just older.

195,LifeProTips,"LPT: Sending a resume by email? Name it ""YourName.pdf"" instead of ""resume.pdf"", so the person downloading and reading resumes can tell which is yours.","For someone downloading and reading resumes, it can get a little frustrating to have a bunch of files all named ""resume.pdf"" or ""resume.docx"".  So make the file name your full name, or something like ""YourNameResume.pdf"" or ""YourName-Position.pdf"" so whoever is reading them doesn't have to rename yours.  It's a nice touch, and shows you're thinking of the needs of the company you're applying to.

Also, use the body of the email for your cover letter, (so it's more likely to be read) then have the resume as an attachment.  If you want to send a properly-formatted cover letter along with your resume, make it a two-page document with the cover letter as the first page and the resume as the second page.  And if you have a choice, pdf is better than doc or docx, because you can be absolutely sure it looks like you want it to.

edit: For anyone having trouble saving a document as a PDF, [CutePDF](http://www.cutepdf.com/) is a nice piece of free software that will work with any Windows software that has a ""Print"" function.  It shows up like a printer, so all you have to do is print the document out, (even if you're not connected to a printer) and it will automatically save it as a PDF on your computer."
196,LifeProTips,"LPT: Wear ear plugs to a concert.

I'm also a musician, so I can vouch that wearing a tiny set of disposable ear plugs will make your concert experience much more enjoyable. The ear plugs block most of the highs and make the sound condensed into a much more balanced sound. Everything becomes much more clear, and you won't leave the concert with that annoying ringing.

202,LifeProTips,"LPT: Listen to an audio book, only when working out. So when you want to hear more, you want to work out more.","EDIT:

Wow, didn’t expect this sort of response when going to bed last night and especially didn’t expect the backlash I got for this. I really feel the need to address this instead of just ignoring it and reason what made me write this tip. First of all, it’s called life pro TIPS, so it’s not something that you have to do, and if this doesn’t work for you, I don’t see why you should. The thing is that on this subreddit, I’ve seen posts before that I knew right away that it wouldn’t work for me, so I just ignored it. I thought that was the thing to do. Instead people started to rage about this and when I woke up this morning I wondered why I had 200+ comments where half said thanks and half of you hated it. 

I think the first misconception came when I had the word work out in the title. This is my first sign of “regret” that I probably should have used a different wording. In my native language, the word for work out is the same for all work outs, and that’s what I thought would be the same thing here, and it probably still is. But people assumed directly that work out is lifting weights and pumping on the gym. And you are probably right when you say that this doesn’t work while you are on a gym and lifting weights, but you also need to understand how many different kinds of workouts there is and my “go to” training is cardio. I have started a habit to run long and I’m now in a place that I have to run every day. I’m also a guy who over thinks EVERYTHING so if I  would listen to music, I would just think of the number of songs I’ve heard and with simple math trying to figure out my time, which seriously doesn’t work for me. I started to listen to audio books and only when running, and find myself lost in my audio book and my running and I could run for 45 min to an hour without thinking. So as I said in the beginning, this is a tip for people who maybe have problem going back to working out (which is a really important thing to do). 

I’ve also read some people saying things like “why don’t you just stop being a fat fuck and the motivation would be to not be a fat fuck” or something like that. While I first thought it was just a random troll, I still felt a reason to address this as well. First of all, I’m not a “fat fuck”. The thing with motivation is that it works different with different people. A few years ago I worked out almost two times a day in a sport team before my “posterior cruciate ligament” (I googled translated that) snapped and I had to stop with all exercising for two years. During that time I also had a death to a really close friend and I started to get depressed. While I really felt the need to just “fuck it all”, this tip helped me not to just lie down and feel sorry for myself and instead start running again. Motivation comes in all forms and sizes, and it’s not just for getting up from your couch and stop eating McDonalds or something.

If this is something that you tried now and it works for you, then it would be awesome. But if it’s not something you think would work, then that’s also fine. I just didn’t expect rage for a LPT that might just help someone to start exercising again. I’m also sorry for a long post which probably had a lot of grammatical errors and spelling was probably off as fuck, but as I said; English is not my native language so please don’t try to win any arguments by correcting my spelling.

221,LifeProTips,"LPT: When writing, studying, or reading, listen to music with no vocals","**LPT: When you want to write, study, or read while listening to music, you will find it much more pleasant and will perform much better if you listen to music with no vocals, minimal vocals, or vocals in a language you don't understand.**

The reason for this is you will unconsciously try to cognitively process the words of the song when listening to music with lyrics, which will tend to make you feel overwhelmed and make it more difficult to bring all your focus onto what you are writing or reading.  This is also why watching tv or movies or listening to some type of spoken word radio show while doing these activities tends to go very badly, at least for me, turning one enjoyable activity and one productive one into a hectic mess with the combination of the two.

Classical music, jazz, movie theme songs, and word-free EDF tracks are probably your best bets for this type of multitasking, in that order.  And with classical and jazz music at a minimum I think you should find your performance will be improved even compared to just completing your task in silence with full focus.

225,LifeProTips,"LPT: Brush your tongue every day if you wish to avoid having bad breath. If your tongue is white, it's probably due to a build-up of smelly bacteria. Remember, few people are aware of their own bad breath!","It's remarkable how many young and otherwise attractive people have toilet-breath. They probably brush their teeth on a regular basis and maybe even floss consistently, but without tongue-brushing, bad breath is inevitable.

It can take weeks of brushing to fully remove all of the crud and restore the tongue to its natural pink colour, so be patient.

Edit: There are several other causes of bad breath, including tonsil stones, acid reflux, and tooth decay, but tongue bacteria (or fungus) is one of the major causes, and definitely the easiest to cure.

Edit2: 'Tongue-scrapers' have worked very well for many people, and may cause less gagging than brushing, but brushing by itself has worked for me. If you have gagging issues, start at the front and work your way back day-by-day as you become less sensitive. Also, try clenching your non-brushing thumb in its hand, as that can help suppress the gag-reflex.

I knew instantly what had happened: when I trimmed my goatee, one of those little bits of hair had popped up into it. 

The irritation came and went last night, but when I got up today and still felt it, I knew which remedy was needed. 

I have large glass bowl I've used for this before and soon it was half filled (don't fill the bowl up or the water your face displaces will soak wherever you decide to do this. If you are someone who has trouble keeping your eyes open underwater, this is actually a plus: the blinking will help dislodge this particular mote in your eye.

Place towels, bed linens, etc., under the door to floor space keeping the smoke from coming into your room.
Before opening any windows, make sure to check around your room (to include the ceiling) for signs of potential backdraft or flashover: very dark puffy smoke will be at the top of the ceiling, maybe banking it's way down towards you, puffing in and out from any cracks to where ""air"" may move (that's another reason to stuff under the door).
Obviously you already called 911 and are staying as close to the floor as possible and remaining as calm as you can.

If you come in person to interview or just to get an application, dress nice. Not saying you need a suit and tie to apply for a lifeguard position, but wear decent pants and a nicer shirt (ie: a polo shirt), not ripped jeans and a dirty ""420 YOLO SWAG"" shirt.


When you are talking to people look them in the eyes and engage them. I can't tell you how many people come in to apply for a job and look at their shoes the entire time and mumble responses to my questions.


Make sure your application is readable. I have shit for hand writing but when I was filling out applications it looked like I got an A+ in hand writing class. If I can't read it, I won't hire you. On the same vein, answer ALL the questions. Don't leave half the application blank and expect anyone to call you back.


Put the cell phone away. If you are waiting for someone that is fine, but when someone is talking to you put it away and don't bring it out again until you leave.


If you have questions about hiring, the position, or if there is any word on your application make sure that it is you that is calling, not mom or dad. It is a sign of maturity and that you are responsible enough to follow up yourself. It is a huge red flag if mom is calling me every day to ask questions for you or to push me to give you a job.


source: I do HR at a decent size country club and have been doing the hiring for the last few years and have reviewed more than enough terrible applications and candidates.



Edit: Some of you gave some good advice as well so I will add it as well:



*Use a blue or black pen to fill out an application.



*Don't bring friends with you to apply. 



*Have a professional email address, not  fingerbanger666@gmail.com 



*If possible hand an application to the manager not an employee.



*Don't show up when we are running around like mad people expecting anyone to talk to you or remember you.



*Don't apply too early (we forget about the application) or too late. Try and think of a reasonable time to apply, sorry it is vague advice.



*Don't be late and don't have a poor excuse.



*Know how to shake someone's hand.



*Be confident when you are applying in person.


*Be polite!"

253,LifeProTips,LPT: Travel - lost luggage? Buy new stuff and file a claim.,"You land at the airport, go to the luggage carousel and... nothing. The luggage office says ""Your cases were misrouted; they'll be here tomorrow"" and they send you on your way with a bit of paper. 

The LPT: Buy what you need when you need it. Keep receipts. Don't hold off because ""it'll be here tomorrow""

Buy toothbrush, toothpaste, razors, shampoo, etc as soon as you leave the airport. If stores are open, buy shorts, t-shirt, underwear, whatever you need for at least the next day. The next day call to check on your luggage. If the answer isn't ""We have it here, where can we send it"" then go shopping again and buy whatever clothes you need. 

Keep receipts. 

If you're leaving soon, buy a new suitcase. Keep the receipt. 

Folks often hold off on buying replacements because it feels like ""wasting money"" - but then you strain yourself trying to get by on minimal clothing. This advice was given to me by an airline pilot who was behind me in line for lost luggage - buy what you need when you need it, keep receipts, file a claim. The airline will pay it. 

I've had to do it twice, and both times, even though my cases eventually showed up, the airline reimbursed every penny I filed a claim for. 

(This advice is as of 2007 - YMMV with all the merger madness)

254,LifeProTips,LPT: How to use Price Trackers to wait for the perfect moment to buy any product,"* **How do I keep track of prices**

There are a lot of price trackers out there. I will list a few here

* http://www.cheapshark.com for games (by /u/SN4T14)

* https://www.decide.com/ for electronics and appliances (by /u/philodox)

Some of them support multiple sites as well as multiple countries while others are limited to Amazon US only. To keep track of a particular product, just go to any of the above trackers, search for the product and enter your email address or twitter id and the desired price in the specific fields. Its that simple. Here's an example:

http://camelcamelcamel.com/The-Matrix-Collection-Film-Favorites/product/B001DJLD1M

Just enter the required information and you are good to go. Once you do that you will be notified as soon as the product reaches the desired price you mentioned. Its pretty awesome. The best time to buy a product IMO is when it reaches its lowest historical price. Of course it may take a few months, and is only good for products that you don't require immediately. But if done right, it can save you a lot of money.


* **How much money can be saved buying products at their lowest price**


To get an idea about this, I looked at the lowest price and the usual price(the price at which you can buy the product when not on sale) and formed an excel sheet using the data. Don't confuse the list price with the usual price. The usual price is the price at which you can buy the product regularly, while the list price is the price at which the product was launched. 

Upon analyzing the data, I found that you can on average save approx 30% off regular price if you buy it at the lowest price. That's $300 for every $1000 worth of products you bought. It is a lot of money. Here's the data in excel format(I collected this data from a new subreddit and I only have data for approx 40 products right now)

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B08rF-l_lyR7NW44b0RNTF85U1U/edit?usp=sharing


While most deal sites would say, always buy products at deal prices, I say, always buy products at their lowest historical price. Chances are that you won't regret it for a long time to come. 

**EDIT:** I guess I should add this right here

Check out /r/amazonLP as well(the subreddit I used to get the price data). It lists products that are at their lowest historical price currently."
256,LifeProTips,LPT: Address your friends by their names when new people join your group,"So you're new in a group and can barely keep two new names in your head at a time, let alone a dozen. Does it feel familiar?

Someone brings a new friend to board game night? new guy's first week at the job? Exchange student staying with your family? You know everyone already, help the new folks out!

It keeps them from having to ask for people's names or embarrass themselves by introducing themselves to the same guy three times over the course of one day. Instead, they can just listen for someone to remind them of that person's name, and start connecting their face to the name and vice versa.

This is sort of a reverse LPT in that it's more helpful for others than for you, but with any luck, people can use this when you're new somewhere. Besides, the more familiar they are with your group, the sooner you'll get to know them too.

275,LifeProTips,"LPT: How to destroy memories, like getting that annoying song out of your head","Author: Xiao

Abstract: An unwanted mind pattern can be removed using a simple method: Corrupt the pattern. 

Background: 

The human mind is good at learning patterns and lessons. This has helped ensure survival. This mechanism causes problems when the distinct pattern of a catchy song or the memory of a painful or embarrassing experience gets stuck in your brain like a leech in a place you can't reach. 

A memory is not like a digital video that remains the same no matter how many times you play it. Rather, a memory WRITES OVER ITSELF each time you re-experience it in your mind. Memories are UNSTABLE, and there have been studies in which false memories containing events that never happened into subjects' minds. You can exploit the instability of memories by repeatedly rewriting over the unwanted memory, until the original loses all meaning, context, and structure, rendering it inert if not deleted.

Process for deleting an unwanted brain/earworm:

* Replay the memory, pattern, song progressively mess it up by adding, changing details, pace, exaggerations, distortions. Make it funny, strange, surreal. 
* It is important to STRONGLY experience the distortions in your mind and and associate them directly with the memory.
* Do this repeatedly, CHANGING the pattern each time. Increase the intensity of the distortions with each subsequent repetition, until the original pattern becomes scrambled. 
* The beginning of the pattern is hardest to scramble. It is like the start of the path to the memory. When the original pattern is scrambled, you can set the path from the beginning of the pattern to lead it to a more desired outcome.
* Avoid reminders or things that will re-establish original unwanted memory.


Example: You want to forget ""Call Me Maybe""

* Replay and change lyrics, tempo, key, context: ""Hey, I just m... ight eat a potato, or maybe a banana..."", ""Hey, I just aaaaaaaate a pooootaaato..."", ... ""Hey, I like chicken, I like liver, Meomix..."", ... ""Hay, the horse likes hay...""
* Strongly experience means you have to sing or mouth the new songs. Sing as differently from the original pattern as possible.
* Enough repetitions will unhook that earworm.
* Now you might still have ""Hey"", the beginning of the path. Now you can think about another song that begins with ""Hey""
* Avoid listening to the original song.

**EDIT:** 

How easy this is will vary based on the memory you choose to corrupt. A fresh memory of some faux pas or some recently-heard commercial jingle would be relatively easy to get rid of. Others are mental scars set deep in your long term memories that are near-impossible to wipe, due to your mind anchoring them to different contexts, emotions, and other memories. While it is hard to destroy something so deep, this technique WILL at least soften the impact and blur the harshness of the memory, with enough persistent repetition across long periods of time and upon each willing or spontaneous recall. Over time you can expect the memory to be more and more muddled.

* REPETITION is key. It's unreasonable to expect to erase a persistent brain pattern in under 4 reps. 10 reps recommended, but you should know when it's working.
* FOCUS is key. You must focus on EXPERIENCING EACH NEW DISTORTION so that your mind writes over the old pattern.
* DISTORTION is key. You must make each and every subsequent distortion weirder, stronger, and more ridiculous. If you recall any part of the original pattern in your later repetition, you need to distort harder.
* This is a mind exercise. You only get stronger and more successful if you keep doing it. If you try once or not at all and then give up, you know it's your own fault when you get that worm stuck in your head.

Please note that there was only about 6cm of water in the tub in this video. It only went up to the base of my fingers when I stuck my hand in (left out of the video, oops). It's a brand new golf ball for this video, and the ball I originally used was VERY scuffed up, which I think also helps ensure the bathtub is fully drained by morning. You could also put one of those tiny rubber bands around the middle to make it drain a little faster (I'm embarrassed to admit that I experimented with that, nerd that I am), as sometimes I would come in in the morning and the tub would still have a little bit of water.

Also, there's no tricks... this isn't one of those 'trick' or 'stunt' tubs in any way. :) It really will flip around the drain for almost a minute (or even more if there's a lot of water).

Please note that I don't think this will save the planet or is otherwise significant in any way... I was just goofing around, trying to save some heat on a -30C day, and in the process noticed an unexpected physics quirk at 6am in the shower. Thanks!"

This post was meant for OTC eye drops for redness/allergies/irritation and such. If your prescription drops need to be refrigerated, of course don't do this.

Also, as /u/MouthyMike pointed out below ""you don't actually have to have your eye open.. just drop it in the corner of your closed eye and open your eye then... makes it much easier..""

I do that, and I actually STILL need the drop to be warm. For me, cool drops are like icepicks in my eyes.

I work front desk at a hotel and I can tell you that 75% of the 'issues' I have reported to me originate with 'Do Not Disturb' signs.


**It varies from hotel to hotel,** but these signs are taken quite seriously at some hotels.


**At the property where I work** at you could call for towels to be sent up to the room, but if there is a DND sign on the door we are NOT allowed to knock or disturb you, hotel policy.


Once we have noticed the sign (There is an active list updated every 3-4 hours by walking the floor to see who has them up, and who doesn't.) we **(the staff)** cannot call you unless it an emergency, there is a billing/clerical issue, or you receive a ""personal"" phone call. 


*(Another quick LPT, if you know someone is going to call you at the hotel make sure they know your last name AND room number, most hotels can't transfer calls unless you they know both.)*


If you are staying at a hotel for more than one night and want Housekeeping to tidy up for you, remember to take down the sign.  **At my particular property** could be walking out the door to go out for the day, see a HK and ask them to make sure your room is freshened up, but if you left your DND sign on the door they cannot go in *(Hotel policy does state however that we have to enter the room once every 3 days to make sure you aren't wrecking the room or ...well to be honest, dead.)*

This is last case scenario advice for somebody with no safety net who has just been kicked out of the house. This advice should help you to get back on your feet using the shelter system in America. This is by no means how most homeless live. Most homeless are under a bridge, or in a covered cause way. They are forced to sleep on cardboard pallets in abandoned buildings. This is fancy living compared to how most homeless have to/ forced to/ choose to live. Homelessness is a very complex issue and encompasses a very diverse group of people.
___________________________________________________________________________________


During your eviction hold a ""fire sale"", that is sell everything you own that is not


3 pairs of pants


3 shirts


7 pairs underwear

All of your socks

A blanket or sleeping bag

A backpack to put all of this in

After you have sold all of this stuff for whatever it will go for sight unseen, go to the bank that has your account and do one of two things. If you do not have a negative balance you should deposit all of the money you just made. If you do have a negative balance you should withdraw all of the funds that they will allow you to.

Now go to a different bank and open up an account, but do not get an atm card. This will require you to go to the bank to withdraw money. It will also make it easier to deposit money than to withdraw it.

Now take your backpack and go to the nearest mission, you want to do this pretty early in the afternoon or sooner if you can. Ask the person at the front desk if you can be processed for intake. If they say no tell them you are homeless and ask for the address of the nearest shelter that is taking in people. If they say you're too early ask for when intake is and be there a half hour early, this is because beds go fast. The reason beds go fast is because here you'll get a shower, a bed and a hot meal.
Now that you're in the shelter you must do this one thing. Treat everybody there as a human, you'll be rooming with some pretty sad sorts, and you are no better than they are. The reason they are there is the same reason you are there, it beats the hell out of cold concrete. I can attest to the frigidity of concrete and it'll humble a soul.

Now that you have a bed you need to ask where you can safely store your belongings, this is very important because now you are going to realize the importance of everything you own. Also theft is pretty much the worst thing that could happen to you right now so guard against it.

You'll probably have to go to some church service before dinner. Suck it up and do it, this is your rent that you pay. Close your eyes and think about Half Life 3 finally coming out, or replay all of the greatest things that you've ever done with a girl. Do anything you can that will prevent you from falling asleep and making the pastor/preacher/reverend from having an excuse to kick you out. Also you don't want to insult somebody that has agreed to feed you.

Ok so now it's chow time, eat up. But don't take seconds. I know you're hungry but see that old toothless bastard over there, he's been doing this all his life. You're only going to be here for a week or two max.
Now it's shower time. This is probably going to suck unless you played sports in highschool or showered after gym. You'll be showering with your own gender. This is only as awkward as you make it. But just keep in mind somebody is going to see you naked. After the shower you may be offered socks. Take them! You may even be offered a laundry service. You need to figure out how this is run and who runs it. Get in good with this person so that you can get all of your clothes back when they've laundered them for you. This is important, because now socks are your best friend.

Ok so now you're going to bed and you've been told the rules, lights out after such and such time. Breakfast at such and such time.

You're going to wake up earlier than you usually do. Don't gripe. Make your bed. Go eat. Now go up front and see if you can get an I.D. card or inquire about how to save your bed for the night. You'll probably have to do some chore or such. Do them, remember bed &gt; concrete.

Now that it's morning and you've done your chores. You're going to feel pretty childish. Well it is. Don't get used to it. You should now go out and look for employ. I used to hold a sign near Home Depot or Lowes saying Will Work For Peanuts with a little elephant on it. It worked and I learned many a trade. Usually through this I would befriend somebody who's couch I could sleep on. I did this while I was traveling. 

When I stopped traveling I ended up being roomates with a guy on the job site and we have been great friends ever since. Even though I now live in Chicago and he in Escondido we still talk on the phone.
Until somebody offers you a couch, you need to rinse and repeat this day until you get a couch. Once you get a couch you have access to laundry and hopefully respectable clothes. If you have gotten on in a job site you might even have learned a trade much as I did. If not well apply to any local coffee shop or small business that gives interviews. Tell the interviewer what you've just been through. People will generally hire you on at a low wage and train you because you're showing more initiative than most candidates. Also many people want to help. More people want to help you than you'll ever know. Cherish this fact and pay it forward. It'll reward you more than anything.

I was homeless and traveling from age 18 to 23. I'm now 27 and going to school under the Pell Grant for Computer Science and have enough knowledge to build my own house. I wouldn't have any of this knowledge if I was not in your position when I was younger. I regret not going to college sooner but everybody has their cross to bear.

From [CXR1037](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihh7r) Look up a food not bombs feeding in your area it's a great place to get lunch and meet people who might let you crash or might have a line on a job. 

From [fearthespoon](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ih1io) Good resource on sleeping in a car as a shelter. I was never lucky enough to have a car but it's a good point nonetheless. 



From [00fordmc](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihu9n) It is definitely important to be aware of your surroundings and know that not every one of your peers wants to give you a hand up.



From [flooing](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ii2gj) If you are a guest in somebody's home you are a fucking guest. Do the dishes, make your bedding invisible, be up before they are with coffee and breakfast. Also learn to dumpster so you can contribute food to the house without using precious money

From [superconfused](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihxld) Stay clean and approachable, you'll get much better reactions because believe it or not appearance matters.

From [surejohn](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ih85v) Also it's suggested to bring a towel.

 pack technical underwear if you can get it, it's fast drying and stinks less.

**TL:DR Do what migrant workers do, sleep at a shelter and work for cheap and you'll end up just fine. The American Dream is true if you have drive.**

Aw cripes guys the front page really?! You're too kind to this crusty old bum. "
291,LifeProTips,"Next time your about to sign up for a gym membership... back out right before you sign any contracts, observe your monthly fees decrease. ","I was at Golds Gym the other day, and I pretty much got hustled into a 2 year contract paying $35 a month! (they did give me 2 months free, which seemed great to me.) But I went home, and my friends kept telling me I got ripped off, he only pays $20 a month. 
**Another pro-tip** is that **most contracts have a 3 day grace period** (check by state.) So I went to Golds the next day and asked to remove my contract. At first I was offered another free month, than I was offered $25 a month plus the free extra month. I told them I was in college and didn't want to commit to a 2 year contract. So I was offered 3 months free for $25 a month and I'm not bound by any contract, only paying month by month. 

I was shocked at how desperate and cooperative they were when I showed no interest, I had the manager talking to me and trying to work out a better deal. 
Hopefully this helps next time you think about joining a gym..."
292,LifeProTips,"LPT: If you ever kill a fly in your house, do not put it in your garbage can. It may be carrying live maggots which will feed and multiply.","Made this mistake once before, they will feed and multiply on your trash.

EDIT- yes, I admit it. I didn't take the trash out for three days once after dumping some old food in there. But there wasn't much to take out in my defense. "
293,LifeProTips,"When sending in something for RMA, include Skittles, M&amp;M's, or a similar treat in the package. The receiving employee will be more likely to upgrade your item.","I send in things all of the time for RMA. Mostly hard drives and other computer hardware. I've found that when I include a handwritten note explaining the problem with the device(s) and thanking them for their help as well as some skittles/M&amp;M's, more often than not they will upgrade my product. I've received 3TB hard drives back when I RMA'd 1 and 2 TB hard drives, and also have received upgraded video cards. I'm sure that it also depends on what they have at the shop, but the dollar or two extra you spend can't hurt.

EDIT (should have included this originally..): RMA = ""Return Merchandise Authorization""
When you have a product that has become defective and is within warranty, you get an RMA from the company. This allows you to send it in. They will check the device and make sure it truly defective and they will either repair or replace it. A lot of the time they will just replace it when it is cost prohibitive to attempt a repair."
294,LifeProTips,"LPT: If you are ever in a car accident and need to break the windows but don't have anything to break it, take the headrest out and use it to smash the windows.","If you are ever in a car accident, use the headrest to break the window.

297,LifeProTips,LPT: Keep a bottle of water next to your bed. Drink it first thing in the morning and it will help you wake up. ,"You don't have to down the entire bottle. A little less than half will do the trick. Especially if you need to motivate yourself to go to the gym if you use ""too tired this AM"" as an excuse."
298,LifeProTips,LPT: Please wear your seat belts. I just had to check for a pulse on a 17 year-old laying face down in the dirt. He didn't have one.,"About 30 minutes ago I was driving home from the movies, saw a civic hatchback wrapped around a tree and ran over to check on them. At least 3 other people were standing there taking pictures on their phones. No one had called 9-1-1.

I yelled for someone to call and then checked on the two kids that were in the car. One was crushed inside the driver's side and the other was ejected. Checked on the ejected one first; he had no pulse, wasn't breathing, and multiple bones were out of his body. The other was having trouble breathing and struggling to get out so I calmed him down, kept him talking to me, and stabilized his neck until the paramedics arrived. He had to be cut out of the car with the jaws-of-life.

**PLEASE WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS!**

**Edit:** I typed this up about 30 minutes after law enforcement let me leave, it was after midnight. I left out a few details and didn't clarify things so I will now:

* I am fine. I did not witness the accident. I arrived moments after it happened.
* I was in the army and part of basic training is combat first aid. A lot of this applies to real life situations too. It just kind of kicked in.
* I did point to a specific person when I yelled ""CALL 9-1-1, NOW!"" She did.
* I directed other by-standards to stop all traffic coming on our road (one-way road)

For those saying that I should have tried CPR on the kid that was ejected:

* He was laying face down
* I checked for responsiveness
* I checked for breathing
* I saw a lot of blood underneath him, but none on top, so I ran my hands underneath his body without moving him to check for arterial bleeding. His neck had a massive hole in it that half of my hand fit in. I could feel bones.

I am around for a bit if anyone has any questions. I'd be happy to answer them.

**Edit2:** The driver is in the ICU, but will live. The passenger was pronounced dead at the scene."
301,LifeProTips,LPT Announcement: We'll be continuing with self-posts indefinitely (read more inside),"[Original Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/11ateq/lpt_announcement_on_monday_1015_well_be_doing_a/)

Before reading any further please note that Indefinitely !== Forever!

The trial of self-posts only for a week ended today and we have to say that it was rather successful. The discussion and submission quality drastically improved, the spam filter was way down, and lots of people wrote in to express their gratitude for trying something like this.

As of now, we have no plans to switch the submissions back to also allow link posts, since the only thing that is really gained from it would be (link) karma. You can still submit images in self-posts and comment on the article to obtain that sweet karma that you may fiend for, but for now self-posts are in.

**Please upvote this thread so it gets visibility (I get no karma for self-posts).**

As always, we'll keep this thread open for additional discussion where you can express your opinion and myself as well as the other mods will be in here to answer your questions/concerns.

**Update:** Some of you have mentioned of allowing link posts once per week. This is kind of a nice idea, so every Wednesday we'll open up the flood gates for linked posts."

305,LifeProTips,LPT: Make it so your dryer's automatic cycle dries your clothes properly,"Inside pretty much all dryers that have an automatic cycle, there will be a pair of electrodes. These generally take the form of two long steel bars mounted in plastic. [(They look like this).](http://imgur.com/PAT7v) As your wet clothes rub against the bars, a voltage is transferred from one bar to the other. This voltage decreases as the clothes dry out. Once it drops to a certain point (based on where you put the knob), the dryer will shut off.

If you use dryer sheets, they tend to coat everything in the dryer with a film over time. This film builds up an insulating layer on top of the electrodes, and prevents them from accurately measuring the moisture content of your clothes. So, the dryer thinks that it has finished before it really has.

The simple fix is to periodically scrub the electrodes with a scotch-brite pad, or very fine steel wool or emery paper.

Of course, you should also make sure your ducts are clean, and while you are at it, scrub your lint filter with a bristle brush. The dryer sheets also form a film over the mesh, causing a measurable reduction in the amount of air that can flow through the filter. "
306,LifeProTips,LPT: Hurricane preparedness:  fill bathtubs with water.  You'll have water to use to flush toilets and for washing in the event of extended power outage.,"Clearly this is more of an issue for those on well-water.  This one has made a nice difference for us during power outages.

This is only one tip from many good ones out there - go google Hurricane preparedness or start at

308,LifeProTips,"LPT: Are your zip-lock bags too small for your needs? Get two, turn one inside out, and lock them together.",It can be a little struggle at first to get them to line up. It has a decent seal if done right and can get you through a pinch if you need it.
309,LifeProTips,LPT: When trying find comparable products to something you want to purchase go to google and type in the product name and then VS afterwards and look at the autocomplete,"Anytime I'm researching a product I also type that in to see what it compares against, generally. Hope it helps somebody. "
310,LifeProTips,"LPT: Work at an office with a gym? Spend an hour there after work, instead of sitting in traffic. ","You don't have to force yourself to get out of the house later in the day. When you get home, you'll feel great and ready for dinner. "
311,LifeProTips,"LPT: To get rid of fruit flies, fill a bowl with apple cider vinegar and a bit of soap. The vinegar attracts them, the soap demoralizes them to become lazy and drown.","Actually the soap kills them when they get into it.  This is sort of an experiment to see if I'll get blue arrows for the title.

But try it!  It's been working well for us. 

Edit: lack of surface tension is the cause of their demise! "
312,LifeProTips,"LPT: Listen to audiobooks while you do tedious tasks, or play video games.","I've listened attentively to about 20 books this summer, and that's probably more books than I've ever read.

Cleaning, vacuuming, mowing the lawn(if you can get powerful enough headphones), driving, etc. can all be productive if you just pop in an audiobook to accompany whatever you're doing. Personally I've been listening to audiobooks while streaming stocks.
It also works well playing games that don't require a lot of attention.

If you're mining linearly in block-building game- listen to an audiobook. Setting up your base in early stages of an RTS game- listen to an audiobook. Grinding for some RPG or MMORPG- listen to an audiobook.

It's a great way to be productive while otherwise doing a mindlessly tedious task. Since the task is so simple, it requires little-to-no brainpower and you can easily concentrate on your book whilst doing it.

EDIT: There's been some discussion- listening to audiobooks while working out isn't for everyone. It's worked well for some people, and horribly (including myself) with others. If you've tried it before while working out and it hasn't worked out for you, give it a shot while doing other things."
313,LifeProTips,LPT: Take notes when calling customer service,"I work customer service over the phone and I hear ""I spoke with someone the other day"" a lot and few customers are ever able to tell me the name of who they spoke to, and oftentimes can't even get the day right. We don't have a universal system that tracks calls, and even if we did not knowing this information leaves it up to us to do our job well (and there are a lot of customer service people who just don't care). 

At work I take notes about every call (name, time, account/policy/whatever #s, what we discussed) and as a customer I have started to do the same in a little notebook I set aside for that purpose. When I recently called my insurance company and was able to tell them exactly who I spoke to and when it lead to a quick transfer, the woman apologizing, and her promising to personally make sure my issue was resolved. What could easily have taken 15+ minutes (a lot longer if put on hold) had I started over took a couple, and it got me someone who was motivated to take care of me.

It also feels better to have your shit in order rather than helplessly hope maybe eventually someone will do things right. And from the other end I appreciate customers who meet me partway and demonstrate a constructive interest in getting things resolved (since all I really want is to get your issue resolved and off my plate).

If they answer the phone ""Hello this is bnyudgcjkg"" (which happens so often I think it is a tactic to avoid giving out their name) politely ask them to repeat their name. And if you get a direct phone# you better not lose that. Those things are golden."
314,LifeProTips,LPT: Buying something small on Amazon and don't qualify for free Super Saver Shipping?  Add some household items that you always need like paper towels or toilet paper to your cart (cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart) and get your entire order shipped for free.,"It annoys me that I have to spend $25 to get free super saver shipping from Amazon when I'm just ordering something small like a CD or DVD.  Instead of wasting more money on buying something else I don't need, I just purchase items that I always need around the house that will push my order over the qualifying amount for super saver shipping.  "
315,LifeProTips,LPT: Carry a few dollars in restaurant gift certificates in your wallet for dilemma-free beggar charity.,"I was often asked for money by homeless people when I worked in downtown LA. I couldn't in good conscience give someone cash who was drinking a bottle of liquor in the morning.  In-n-Out burger used to have these paper gift certificates that came in $1 increments (they may still, it's been a while.) so I kept $5 worth in my wallet to give out as needed.  I never once got yelled at, or anything but a thank you.  There was pretty frequently a moment of ""What the...?"" before they realized what it was, but then it was usually followed with a very genuine smile."
317,LifeProTips,Call a store in a different time zone to get a question answered if your local store is already closed.,"May be obvious to some, but today I had a question about the presta valves on my bicycle but all the local bicycle stores were closed. I ended up calling a store two time zones over and got my question answered. I was proud of myself.

324,LifeProTips,"LPT: Put ""needs meds"" on your pets I.d. tags.","People are more likely to return a dog to its owner if they think the dog needs to be on medication. I've seen this first hand. 

I don't know if this has been posted before, I'm pretty new to reddit so if this is an accidental repost, I'm sorry."
327,LifeProTips,LPT: Get out of your comfort zone occasionally and go out on weekends by yourself,"I used to force myself to do this every once in a while when I was younger and it really changed my life.  I still do this occasionally too.  We often settle into these groups of friends and start to rely on them to have fun, but before long you realize you've built a reliance on them... Half the time people go out, they stand in the same circle and talk about the same shit.  Go out by yourself.  You'll learn to socialize, meet new people, and likely have a hell of a time.  I've had some of my most fun nights this way and made some great friends that have lasted through the years."
328,LifeProTips,"LPT: Before giving your kid your phone, put it in airplane mode. They can't buy or download anything that way.",They also can't accidentally reply to a txt or email.
331,LifeProTips,How to wake up in the mornings. Especially if you are a snoozer.,"You need to practice ""waking up"" to your alarm during the waking hours of the day.  We frequently try to will power our selves out of bed in the morning. However, our minds are obviously functioning at shit levels and making a good decision when you are groggy is near impossible.  The trick is to train your mind so that the response is automatic and not a decision.

1. Pick a song or sound to wake up to.
(Preferably not a song you like, you'll just end up hating it)

2. After you've been up for at least an hour or two, set your bedroom like you would for going to bed.. Close the shades turn the lights off, and whatever else you feel is necessary. 

3. Set your alarm to go off in 5 mins after you've laid down. 

4. When you hear your alarm go off, get up and start doing things  that you might do when actually waking up.

5. Repeat this twice a day for one month and you will never go back to hitting the snooze again.

This works especially well because it is self reinforcing. 
"
332,LifeProTips,LPT: Taking a deep breath and holding it while brushing your tongue will help you resist triggering your gag reflex.,"If you take a deep breath and hold it, letting the pressure push against your throat, you will have a much easier time brushing your tongue without almost throwing up. Most people just stick their tongue out as far as they can, which is also good, but this can help you get a little further back without a problem.

Having said that, you still might trigger it.

EDIT: There are some other great tips in the comments section from other users. All the deepthroating references - meh.

Other users' suggestions for the lazy: 

1. Squeeze your non-dominant hand or thumb in the fist of that hand.

2. Breathe through your nose deeply.

3. Hum

4. Exhale

336,LifeProTips,MOD POST: Enough with the LPT Requests that can easily be answered with a simple Google Search.,"People, enough. If you can find answers via Google to your LPT Request question, then don't submit it.

If you see LPT Request posts that go against this, please report them to the moderators. You can do this by copy and pasting the link and messaging the moderators, or simple hit the report button below the post (near where it says comments, etc.)

Edit: subreddits like /r/answers, /r/advice, /r/help, /r/self could be potential outlets for specific questions. Often there are subreddits dedicated to specific ideas/subjects so you can do a search and perhaps find one better suited for your inquiry or discussion (i.e. fashion advice, makeup advice, legal advice, relationship advice, medical advice, cars, recipes, cooking, and so on)."
338,LifeProTips,"If your baby or small child is waking up too early, put him or her to bed earlier, not later. This is counter-intuitive but it works and is easily explained biologically.","We found this out after our first son was waking at 5 am. Friends had the same problem with their daughter, so they kept putting her to bed later.  

We were told by a paediatrician to put our child to bed earlier.  With a 7 pm bedtime, he slept until 6:30. We adhered to the bedtime like we were OCD and it was magic.  

Our friends stuck to their plan and ended up with a midnight bedtime claiming that they had to because she would wake too early otherwise. She made up for the lost sleep by napping.

342,LifeProTips,LPT: You can make banana ice cream with just bananas,"1. Slice and freeze bananas
2. Put sliced bananas in food processor or blender
3. It'll magically turn creamy like a banana ice cream
4. ~~Get naked~~ and enjoy ice cream

You can also put in flavors (like vanilla extract or coconut milk... I might try using cocoa or something).

I was craving ice cream but I've gotten pretty tubby recently. My friend told me about this and I was actually surprised at how it turned out. There are a ton of youtube videos with this.

There are pictures [here](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-creamy-ice-cream-w-93414) and [here](http://jamiecooksitup.net/2013/01/one-ingredient-frozen-banana-ice-cream/)!"
344,LifeProTips,LPT: Wear your favorite clothes when you go shopping for more.,"If you wear your favorite clothes while you try other things on, you'll be able to judge if you really love new clothes before buying them. If you walk into the changing room wearing old ratty sweats that make you feel terrible, new clothes you try on will have to meet a lower standard. If you wear what you feel best in and can still impress yourself with your new clothes, they're probably worth buying. "
345,LifeProTips,"LPT Request: How to respond to the question ""do you know how fast you were going?""","I feel like if you get pulled over by a police officer, and s/he asks you this, there is no right answer.

You could say ""I was driving [insert speed within speed limit]"" and lie, and get contradicted by police. Not good, right?

You could say ""I was driving too fast"" and pretty much plead guilty on the spot. Also not good, right?

Then there's the ""I don't know"", which tells them you're a shitty driver."
346,LifeProTips,LPT: Keep a folder in your work e-mail for the compliments/kudos you've received,"I find when I'm feeling unmotivated or stumped, I can look at these kudos and instantly feel better."
347,LifeProTips,"LPT:  When assembling a piece of furniture, tape the wrench key to the bottom or back.","Title pretty much sums it up.  Kinda obvious one, but a lot of people don't think about it in the moment.  Really helps for when you have to disassemble it or tighten a few loose bolts.

EDIT:  As so many commenters have pointed out, yes, it's a good idea to own a set of tools.  Still though, what if you're assembling some little table or stool that's going to a weird place like a college dorm or your workplace?  It's the handiness of having the key there, not the notion that it covers all your bases."
348,LifeProTips,"LPT: If you see a baby animal by itself and it looks healthy, its mom is just probably off finding food, leave it be.","Almost all moms have to leave their babies at some point to go and get food.  They are not abandoned, leave them be.  If they are in a particularly unsafe spot, you can move them to a safer location (as long as it is not too far away, the mom can call for it and find it again).  

If they look sick or malnourished then by all means, help the little bugger."
350,LifeProTips,LPT: Smile before answering the phone. It will make you sound happier and lead to a better conversation.,"Great tip for sales people, but also useful in everyday life."
351,LifeProTips,LPT: Deodorant on an insect bite or other itchy site will stop the itch.,"While I definitely wouldn't recommend putting it on severe rashes or any open skin, running deodorant over an insect bite stops the itch almost immediately! I keep a stick of unscented deodorant specifically for this purpose. In some cases, I've found it works better than anti-itch creams - plus it's less messy."
353,LifeProTips,"LPT: Do not ask if there is anything on the resume that concerns the interviewer. Instead, ask about opportunities you'll be presented with in five years if you joined the company tomorrow.","The one about ""Is there anything on my application that concerns you"" is a horrible idea.

Here are some real questions you should ask:

""Assuming everything for today were to work out, what sort of opportunities will I be presented with in five years?""

""I've done XXXX research about your company; however, I was unable to find any information about YYYY, can you tell me anything about this?"" (exampe: Previous CEO, Current CEO)

""If I were to join your team, what would you recommend for me to do to ensure my transition be as smooth as possible?"" 

""Do you have an email or phone number I can note so we can keep in touch?""

""What are the positives and negatives about working here?""  (You probably won't get negatives. I only got them once)

Edit:  It's interesting how the opinions of reddit strongly disagree with each other. My questions above are more geared towards large companies, or any where you want a career. I think the better advice here is what I saw someone else write, there is no such thing as a blanket interview set of questions.... And I don't think anyone should use these verbatim. You should be able to spin your own style off of all interview advice, and secure your own job. "
359,LifeProTips,"LPT: Wake up earlier, your day will actually be better.","This might be a no brainer for some but a lot of people, myself included, like to roll over and go back to sleep until the very last moment they need to wake up. For a week now I've been waking up an hour earlier than I need to, getting ready for the day, then relaxing by watching some tv or something before I need to leave. Getting up earlier is without a doubt why I don't feel rushed and anxious the rest of the day, as a student it helps me focus during class, and I generally have a more productive, less stressful day."
360,LifeProTips,"LPT: Fast food alternative for broke college students. 30 bucks a week for excellent, healthy food. ","I've been seeing a lot of posts recently about broke college students and their fast food habits. I'm here to offer a dissenting opinion. Fast food is bad for you, and while easy, eats away at your wallet when you could be having better and more food for less money. 

The trouble of course, comes from budgeting. I spend 60 bucks a week at my local WinCo (most of the time, less) and buy produce. If you know how to use the produce, you can stretch it into far more meals than you could just going to McDonalds and dropping 3.50 on a one-serving nugget salad. You have to know where to shop for this to work. Albertsons/Vons/Whole Foods? Little too pricey. Ralphs/Fred Meyer? Closer to the target. What you're looking for is bottom of the food chain bulk/wholesale food, like WinCo/Smart And Final/ CostCo/BigLots, etc. 

Now, it doesn't take much to cook at home. All you really need is a frying pan, a stock pot, and a knife. You can even get away with just a microwave and a knife, but you have to be more creative about it. Now, eating well is super super easy, but nobody knows how to do it because nobody takes the time to learn. There are TONS of youtube channels out there that teach you how to cook, all you have to do is search for them. If you have a TV, watch the Food Network for a few days and you'll start picking things up. 

Anyway, here's how my budget works. Half of my weekly budget is spent on produce, and honestly, I could get by on just that. 30 bucks of produce a week and ANYONE would be fine. You just have to know what to buy. First of all, never buy anything that's out of season if you can avoid it. Don't buy avocados unless you're in California (and even then, prices go way up out of season) or they're in season. If you buy avocados out of season, the quality will be lower and you'll be paying a substantial markup. ~~Buy those packages of romaine hearts (3.25) (3 per bag), a box of garlic croutons (1.50) and a container of caesar dressing (2.50). 3 (or more if you don't have a huge appetite) big, healthy meals for 7.25.~~ Buy a box of arugula or spinach, and just add a simple vinaigrette and maybe a sliced hard boiled egg. Incredibly simple, and even cheaper than the original caesar salad example which everyone hated.  You can stretch your money even further if you have a pressure cooker or crock pot. 6 dollars of vegetables (onion, carrot, celery, salt/pepper) and 4 dollars of meat (stew beef), throw into a crock pot for 7 hours and you'll have yourself an incredible stew that'll last you for at least 5 meals. 

I'm a broke college student myself, and I can make it work on 30 bucks a week. If I can do it, you can as well, all it takes is some prep time and a little bit of motivation to learn how to cook basics. Steaming, boiling, frying and chopping. If you can do those things, you can eat really well for really cheap. Of course, I would be happy to answer any questions about how to budget and prepare food, because I had to learn all this by myself and want to share food with everyone. 

By request, edit 8: **TL;DR-- if you go to Winco or other bulk wholesaler, you can buy pretty much everything on the cheap, and if you go to YouTube, you can learn how to cook it all. Finally, if you go to Amazon, you can buy a knife, a frying pan, and a stock pot and start eating healthier, more filling, and cheaper food.**

~~Edit: I don't know why something like this would get downvoted. It's bizarre to me that there are people that are so fast-food centric that they'd be aversive to better health and saving money and gaining a practical life skill. I'm not even upset, it's just wildly confusing.~~ Nothing here but us chickens, boss. 

Edit 2: Eggs are cheap. If you know how to fry an egg, you will never go hungry. Buy eggs. 

Edit 3: Avocado clarification: Avoid buying avocados when they're off-season. Any way you slice it, you're paying an obscene amount more than you should for them at any point that isn't the summer. As for the Californians part, that's just a bonus. If you live in California, you're going to pay less for avocados. Even less if it's during the summer. The general point to this edit is to pay attention to seasonal/regional things. If you can get them from nearby and they're in season, you'll pay a TON less. Avoid out of season produce. 

Edit 4: As flohammed_albroseph pointed out, Pasta was missing from this list. Pasta is great because you can dress it a thousand and one ways, and have a different meal every time. Plus, if you buy in bulk, you can get pasta on the cheap. It lasts forever, too. 

Edit 5: As is being pointed out in the comments, the Caesar salad example was a poor choice. While it still is healthier than anything you would find in a fast food joint, it's still unhealthy in relative terms. For broke college students who are struggling to just get chemical energy in an easy and (still, comparatively) healthier way, a caesar isn't a bad choice-- however, it's worth mentioning that there are easier and healthier salads out there which can't be ignored. When in doubt, grilled (or baked, or pan fried, or anything as long as it's cooked) chicken, sliced hard boiled egg, romaine lettuce, and fat free ranch. 

Edit 6: For those just showing up to the party, I strongly recommend reading the comments. Lot of people suggesting healthy, cost-effective meals down there, as well as having high quality discussion in general. 

Edit 7: Let's talk meat. Now, a lot of people assume that meat is expensive. To some degree, that's correct-- but really only regarding quality cuts of beef. Here's the thing, if you don't buy it prepackaged in the meat aisle at your favorite market, you can save some money by visiting a butcher. If you don't have a butcher in your town, the deli counter in a market can still save you some money. Boneless chicken breasts are actually the best choice here. They're the most versatile of any meat when trying to eat healthy and cheap. Sausage (bratwurst and such) is a close second, and the stuff is pretty filling. Cuts of fish like Mahi Mahi and Salmon can fluctuate wildly, so keep your eye on the prices as you shop. If you come in next time and see that it's a buck less per pound, it's time to stock up. "

So my tip is this: If you're starting a new hobby don't just read a couple of tutorials and start. **Immerse** yourself in the community for that hobby. Being a part of something really helps you stick with whatever you chose. It will help you stay motivated and inspired. It will open up new ways to look at the hobby, ways you probably couldn't have come up with yourself. It will also show you some ""end-game"" content: what it looks like when you've invested a lot of time into this hobby. It will enable you to visualize your goals better.

And finally, share whatever you can. Let others critique your work/collection/whatever. It will help you get better at the hobby and helps you feel connected.

Without this, you're very likely to give up on the hobby."

373,LifeProTips,"LPT: In interviews, when you're stuck for words, silence is your best friend.","When you're searching for words in an interview, simply say nothing. The pause will both give you time to think and show your interviewer that you're being reflective or giving extra thought to what you want to say next.  If you use words such as ""uh"", ""like"", or ""um"", you come off as indecisive.  

You may fear that your pauses are too long, but that's rarely a concern. If you're prepping for an interview, record yourself and listen. You'll notice that those pauses aren't really as long as you think.

Bonus: If you really have trouble getting rid of ""like"", try subbing it out with ""for instance"". Having to think every time you say it will dramatically lessen your use of the phrase and you'll sound more intelligent in the process.

376,LifeProTips,"LPT: Before you open a bag of cereal, take it out of the box and put it back upside down. You'll mix up the small and large pieces and avoid getting a bowl of crumbs at the end of the box","Any cereal with non-uniform piece sizes will, over the course of shipping and handling, mix itself up unfavorably. The large pieces stay on top, the small pieces fall toward the bottom, and the crumbs end up at the bottom of the bag. 

Before you open the bag of cereal, take it out, flip it upside down, and replace it in the box. Give it a few good shakes to distribute the crumbs throughout the bag, and then open the bag from the bottom. This will help the large pieces now at the bottom work themselves up as they get displaced by the small ones, and you'll be much less likely to get a bowl entirely of crumbs at the end of the bag.

Caveat: Some cereal bags are more reinforced at the bottom (so the bag is normally easier to open) so take care opening or you get [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/rfYRr.jpg)

383,LifeProTips,LPT: Make Better Tasting Coffee,"So let's assume you aren't a coffee snob. You're a regular guy who drinks Folger's and 7-11 coffee, and you don't think it is half bad.

**Here are a few ways you can make your coffee taste better:**

*Before brewing:*

Add stuff! A pinch of salt will take some of the bitterness out of your coffee and make it taste a bit more smooth, but only add a bit. You can add other stuff too. I used to add a few pinches of ground cinnamon and a dash of vanilla extract to my coffee grounds before brewing to improve taste. *Experiment with it.*

**Quantity:** 4 tablespoons for every 3 cups of coffee. Or get a coffee scoop and it will be two scoops to every three cups. This brews coffee that is a bit dark, and we will get into that if you like lighter coffee. Putting less grounds in when you brew can often ""burn"" the grounds resulting in worse flavor. *If you like lighter coffee*, brew a half of what you normally would and when it is finished, add water to taste. This way you can have lighter coffee with a better flavor.


Lastly, if you already do some all or all of those things, *here are some of the biggest factors that affect coffee flavor*:

**Freshness:** How old is the coffee, and how recently was it ground? Ground coffee ages faster than unground, so if you don't mind the extra hassle, you might think about buying whole bean coffee and grinding before you brew.

**Water:** Tap water will, in theory, brew worse coffee due to it's impurities. Filtered water or distilled water would technically be the best, but may or may not be worth the hassle to you. Using tap water also has more calcium build up over time and will mean that you have to clean your coffee maker more frequently.

**Grind:** How finely or coarsely ground your coffee is *will* affect the flavor, especially if you start buying whole bean and grinding it yourself. There are ""correct"" grinds for different brewing methods, but for a regular brewer, a finer grind will result in darker coffee. Don't overdo it with this, it's easy to brew something undrinkable if you get the grind too far from what it should be, and coffee that s too finely ground will be very bitter.

**Proportion:** We already covered this. If you brew the right amount of grounds to water, you optimize the flavor.

**Edit: French Presses:**

So you really like coffee, and you are ready to try something new. You should pick up a [french press.](http://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Kenya-17-Ounce-Coffee-Press/dp/B000YYODLO/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363459839&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=french+press)

French presses are great because they:

* Are easy to use,

* Easy to clean,

* And make better coffee.

If you are just getting started, all you really need is a *french press*, some ground *coffee* (typically a bit coarser than used with a standard machine, but using the same grind for both won't impact the flavor too badly), and a way to get *water* almost to boiling temperature (200 degrees F is ideal).

You put the grounds in the french press with the lid/plunger removed, and add water until it is full. With the handle of the plunger pulled all the way out, put the lid back on. Let the coffee steep for 2-5 minutes before you depress the plunger (depress the plunger slowly and steadily), and once the plunger is all the way down, you are ready to pour yourself a cup.

When adding the water, two important notes: 
**Don't use boiling water** or you will scorch the grounds, and try to make sure you pour the water so that **all of the grounds get wet**. Usually this won't be an issue, but now and then you'll get pockets of grounds that stay dry. *Post-Script: Many people have suggested stirring your grounds or using a spoon to immerse them into the water, and this will yield better results for your effort.*

You can incorporate the other elements of this post with your french press, though as another user has mentioned, I would recommend not using salt when brewing with a french press, as it is often not necessary."
384,LifeProTips,"LPT: When meeting a person for the first time, ask them about ""what they like to do"", rather than asking them about ""what they do"".","You meet someone for the first time and ask them, ""What do you do?"".  They respond with a scripted answer of their job tittle and duties and maybe some history of their employer or the field they work in.  They ask you the same question and you take your turn mindlessly telling them about your mundane job.  The conversation peters out because you can both sense no one is in the mood to talk about work. 

But what if you had asked this person, ""What do you like to do?"".   The response from this question will be drastically different.  The person will become excited and talkative while they are sharing what they do for fun or where they like to travel.  Who knows, you may share an interest or hobby that would have remained buried if you had never asked the question.

I know that many conversations will naturally progress from talking about work or school to things like hobbies and passions.  However, first impressions are important and time is of the essence.  When someone is walking away from a conversation with me, I want them to remember me as the guy who is excited and passionate not they guy who is boring and overworked.

TL:DR, Have better conversations when meeting new people by asking them about they like to do and not what they do.

386,LifeProTips,"LPT: For real insomniacs, DON'T focus on your breathing. Instead, let your imagination wander, and let daydreaming turn into real dreaming. If it can put you to sleep in class, it can put you to sleep in bed.","I'm an insomniac, a bad one. It has affected my life quite negatively at times, and I find that many of the tricks that other people use to sleep don't work for me.

(Disclaimer: If breathing concentration works for you, go for it. But I know that for myself and many other insomniacs it doesn't. For you special and unfortunate few, try daydreaming... at night.)

When your eyelids shut, **don't try not to think**. We all know that leads into the cycle of thinking about trying not to think and thinking about trying to not think about thinking about not thinking... and then it's 7AM and you're a bleary-eyed wreck. If it doesn't work for you, don't do it.

Instead, allow your mind to think. But not about real world problems or people. Daydream. Look at the swirls of color inside your eyelids and watch them morph into new shapes and figures. Let your mind's eye show you whatever fantastic situations and characters it wants to. With your eyes closed, you can see some pretty psychedelic stuff.

It's fun in a very relaxing way, and once you're doing it, you're almost asleep. You're daydreaming, but when you fall fully asleep there are no consequences. The teacher isn't going to call you out. You won't hit your head on your desk. You'll just be asleep.

I like this technique because:

* It's fun
* It stops your mind from racing and lets it walk 
* I see cool psychedelic stuff without being on drugs 
* It relaxes me automatically, more than systematic relaxation methods
* It leads naturally into sleep 

This might sound like a bunch of hippie bullshit to you, but I would urge you to try it before you knock it. No drugs were used in this technique and it got me through an absolutely hellish few semesters at college.

tl;dr: Do not try to shut down your brain. Just turn on the screensaver and look at cool stuff until it goes to sleep on its own."

There's the old saying, ""You can't help someone who won't help themselves"", well this tip takes that a bit further ""Don't help someone who won't help themselves""

If you're a helpful person, chances are you find yourself always with a promise to keep, and some people may in fact be taking advantage of the fact that you will always be available for them.

**Protip: Whenever someone asks you for some kind of favour, create a little hurdle for them to do in order to redeem the favour.**  
If they're not willing to cross the hurdle, then what they needed from you was clearly not important enough for them.

For example, if a family member needs tech support for their computer, rather than drop everything and go around to help them - I'll ask them to deliver the computer to me at work. If it's not that important for them, they won't be bothered to bring it to me and I won't have spent my time and resources on it.  
If it's really important enough for them, then they'll do it and I'll happily fix it for them at that point. 

Sometimes it's as simple as 'Write me an email with all the details, and I will follow it up from there'.

You get to continue to be that helpful person, and you won't end up wasting your time on things that aren't that necessary."

398,LifeProTips,"LPT: How to make a bed to look like a hotel bed, and other various tips about your hotel room","A few weeks ago I was hired at the Courtyard Marriot as a housekeeper and I saw some interest in how to make beds look as sharp as the ones in our hotels, so I'd like to walk you through the bed-making process!

You will need a:

-Fitted Sheet

-Flat Sheet

-Comforter

-Decorative Sheet

-2-4+ Pillows

-1 Decorative Pillow

-Bed Skirt (Optional)


1. Start with FRESH linens! http://i.imgur.com/dyapWiel.jpg

2. Throw your fitted sheet over the mattress. Doing diagonal corners first helps even it out and look smooth. Put the flat sheet over it and put it to the top of the bed. Put the comforter on over that, and lay it about 5-6 inches below the flat sheet: http://i.imgur.com/nSs7s4ol.jpg

Make sure there is enough room at the foot of the bed for the comforter to fold under the mattress. 

3. Lay the decorative sheet over the other sheets, making it end about right in between the comforter and flat sheet, the fold it about halfway down the bed on both sides: http://i.imgur.com/WXmd3qxl.jpg

4. Next take your flat sheet and fold it over the comforter: http://i.imgur.com/oSLz7jKl.jpg
 
5. Do the same thing to the comforter over the fold of the decorative sheet: http://i.imgur.com/sRV59Cnl.jpg 

6. Wrap the decorative sheet around the comforter and tuck under. This makes that nice looking design: http://i.imgur.com/sHU8lexl.jpg

7. At the bottom of the bed, pull the comforter and flat sheet like so: http://i.imgur.com/UkxExqTl.jpg

And fold it under so that it hangs over the bottom of the bed: http://i.imgur.com/UIHUWjKl.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/plaSiupl.jpg

And repeat on the other side, tuck the entire end of the comforter under the bed. Make sure this is evenly proportioned and there is no unevenness. 

8. Take the decorative sheet and pull the opposite direction as you did the comforter: http://i.imgur.com/CBbyRTSl.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/GumcmeXl.jpg (Sorry, had to take pictures of another bed because my boss actually showed me a better technique later, where you only tuck under the one side, so that the side of the bed has a nice flat corner to it. Here is what it should look like: http://i.imgur.com/4uUSFail.jpg

9. Take your stripped pillows and put on fresh pillow sheets: http://i.imgur.com/egKl181l.jpg

10. Lay them on the bed, with the decorative pillow right over the blanket bunch: http://i.imgur.com/ltP0Z3vl.jpg

As you can see in these last picture, the bottom of the beds could be more proportionally tucked underneath, and the way you fold the decorative sheet makes an incredible difference in how the bed looks overall. So do the decorative tuck like I mentioned above and your bed will look quite ravishing! 


Now here are a few tips on your next hotel stay, and this may be specifically to the Courtyard Marriot but it is just a reference: 

-We ALWAYS clean the rooms, up and down, before you stay here. All sheets are fresh when you arrive, every single surface of your room has been sanitized. We even go on our hands and knees to manually wash the bathroom floors. You wouldn't believe how much people shed. Sorry if we miss a hair. 

-If you feel skeptical on your room being cleaned, check to see if there are any fingerprints on the toilet flusher.

-At the Courtyard Marriot we only refresh your sheets if you're staying for more than one day if you ask, otherwise we just make your bed up with the same sheets. 

-Last but not least, say hi to the housekeepers! We are the silent heroes of the hotel business and we really do our best to make your stay as inviting as possible. We do not cut corners, we work our asses off, and luckily for me, I love it. We rarely get tipped, but when we do it makes our entire day better knowing that people care about us as much as we care about you!

If you have any more questions on your hotel stays, ask away!

400,LifeProTips,LPT: Cheer up some one who is cranky with a Jedi Mind Trick,"Let me start off by saying that this is a ridiculously simple trick. It works best on children but I have used it on grown ups as well. That being said I still use it all the time since it can be so effective. Hopefully some one out there can use it to cheer some one up.

First you need a some one who is grumpy (they don't *have* to be grumpy but it makes it easier). Tell the person that if they don't cheer up you will use a Jedi Mind Trick on them. You will typically get a response along the lines of ""there is no such thing"" or ""that's stupid"". This attitude is actually helpful for the trick to work.

Then, with a dead serious look on your face, look them directly in the eyes. Hold their gaze for a second or two and say ""smile"". (I told you it was ridiculously simple)

In my experience they will crack a smile in under 10 seconds even if they don't want to. Once they start to smile they will giggle a bit because your Jedi Mind trick was effective even though they thought it was a waste of time.

Once they smile for a couple of seconds their mood will lighten a bit.

 This trick works best on younger kids but I do it to my wife when she is feeling grouchy and it still works every time. Also, the trick has a cumulative effect. My oldest son who is now 15 will crack a smile every time I tell him I'm going to use my Jedi skills on him if he doesn't cheer up. Any one with teenagers knows this can be particularly useful since teenagers generally have something bothering them.

To be clear, when I say ""grumpy"" or ""cranky"" I do not mean angry or pissed off. This works best on folks that are just a little agitated or mildly frustrated. If they are *really* upset you're on your own.

Use your new found powers wisely.

There's [no](http://cancer.about.com/od/cancercausesfaq/f/freezingwaterbo.htm) [need](http://www.jhsph.edu/dioxins) [to](http://www.plasticsmythbuster.org/main-menu/plastics-rumor-registry/freezing-plastic-water-bottles-releases-dioxins-into-water-)

Other tips:

1. **For some cool drinking water at the start of your trip**, freeze some half-full bottles and then fill them up with cold water just before you put them in the cooler.

2. **Make sure you pre-chill all the food** before you put it in the cooler. If your food can be frozen without affecting the quality (milk, most soups, chilis, etc.) and you won't need it right away, freeze it. You can freeze juice boxes. Don't freeze canned beverages or foods.

3. If you have a large chest freezer with enough room, **freeze your entire cooler** for a few hours before loading it. If your freezer isn't that big, you can pre-cool your cooler putting some ice in it for 6+ hours. Dump out the meltwater and dry it out, then load it up.

4. **Pack related items together inside a large ziplock bag**, such as condiments or sandwich ingredients, or everything you'll need for a certain meal. That way it's easier to find everything you need quickly so the cooler is open for shorter times, and the food will stay drier. Throw in a few extra bags to store leftovers. Foods that come in a ""resealable"" package will probably not stay dry if they get submerged in meltwater once they've been opened; put them in a ziplock bag.

5. **Keep your cooler out of the sun, and don't leave it in a hot vehicle** if you can safely store it somewhere else. If it does have to stay in the sun or a vehicle, cover it with a blanket, towel, or reflective emergency blanket. (If you're camping, don't leave your cooler in your tent or outside. Hungry animals and/or people will show up.)

6. **Keep a thermometer in your cooler.** Your food should stay below the ""[danger zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_zone_\(food_safety\))"" temperature of 5°C / 41°F. Foods that are potentially hazardous if they spend two or more hours in the danger zone are: meat, fish, poultry, eggs, protein rich foods, dairy products, cut or peeled fresh produce, most cooked foods, shellfish, sauces and gravies, sprouts, and any foods that contain any of these items.

7. If you need your cooler to stay cold longer, and/or to stay cold enough to keep things frozen, **find a dry ice distributor** in your area. (Regular ice will *not* keep things frozen.) Wrap the dry ice block in a towel and put it in your cooler. Be careful when handling dry ice; it's not toxic but if you touch it you will have a bad time.

8. Plastic **egg carrier cases** work well, but they take up a lot of space even when they're almost empty. (Two small carriers is better than one large one!) A cardboard egg carton inside a plastic bag is fine as long as you're careful not to crush it, and if space is needed you can cut off the unused cells. Hard-boiled eggs can be pre-peeled and kept in a ziplock bag. If you're making scrambled eggs, pre-mix them and put them in a tight-sealing container or wide-mouth bottle. It is possible to freeze eggs too, but [with some preparation](https://www.google.com/search?q=freeze+raw+eggs)."

* Place a mm ruler up against your eyes, resting it on the bridge of your nose. 
* Line up the starting point (0 mm) with your left (or right) pupil. This measurement is only accurate if you are looking straight ahead. 
* Look at yourself in the mirror or have someone else read the ruler. If someone else is reading the ruler they must be at the same height as you. 
* When the 0 mm mark on the ruler is lined up correctly on the left (or right) pupil the mark that lands in the center of the right (or left) pupil is your distance PD.

* Black Head remover: Rinse face with warm/hot water, then apply a thick paste of baking soda and water to the entire face or afflicted areas. (I suggest doing a test spot for safety!)  Leave the baking soda on for 3-4 minutes, don't leave it on for any longer because it doesn't need it and you don't want to damage your skin. Rinse with warm water, then for an extra toner, mix apple cider vinegar and water, then wipe your face with a cloth dipped in that.  Finally rinse your face with cool water.

* Grout &amp; Mold Cleaner: Apply a tick paste of baking soda and water to your grout and afflicted mold areas (sink, grout, toilet, shower, etc) and let sit for 2-3 hours. Come back and rinse off. I've found this to be more effective than bleach.

* Stove-top &amp; Oven cleaner: Apply a thick paste of baking soda to the caked on food and burnt stuffs on your stove.  Let sit for 2-3 hours, and come back and wipe away, boom, like new. 

* Homemade furniture polish: Mix Vinegar, Oil and Fresh lemon in a dish, and apply to wooden furniture. Is just as effective as expensive polish and doesn't cost anywhere near as much

* Homemade all-purpose cleaner: White Vinegar, Water, and Fresh Lemon.  Wash everything and this will clean it.  Also good on glass, and you can use newspaper to dry glass as it leaves a streak-free dry.

* You *can* mix baking soda into your toothpaste to help with teeth whitening, but be careful as this isn't the best for your gums, especially for prolonged use.

* Put a touch of baking soda into your bath water to help relieve skin irritations.

* Sprinkle baking soda into cat litter to soak up odor

Confidence and positive self image are pretty meaningful to those of us who lack them.

2:  People don't seem to understand the purpose of this.  It isn't ""look at your eyes in the mirror and tell yourself how pretty you are"".  It's, ""Hey, have you noticed if you don't make eye contact with yourself?  Start!""  I never claimed everyone with self esteem issues could use this, nor that only they could.

3:  Given the ""I wish more people would understand mental illness"" thread the other day, I'm appalled at how many people here are being outright insulting to people they know nothing about, nor understand to any capacity.  Mocking people for not being able to look their self in the eye is childish and ignorant, regardless of their mental status."

Otherwise, just acknowledge the issue and dive right into finding a solution. 

EDIT: Edited to take the focus off the phrase ""I'm sorry"" because it's about the apology, not the words, and because ""I'm sorry"" can be used in other contexts such as expressions of compassion or condolence.

EDIT # 2: A lot of people seem to interpret this as me saying that you should never apologize and that you instead should justify your actions with no regard for how they affect others. This is NOT the intent. Apologize! Apologize often! Apologize even when something is only loosely your fault, or when you've miscommunicated!

451,LifeProTips,LPT: How to write instructions for teaching people software,"Instructional designer here. I write instructions for all sorts of things but mostly software. We've found the best way to write clear step-by-step instructions is to orient the reader to the location, identify the object, specify the action and describe the outcome. This will seem awkward to most people at first, but it really is easier to follow.

For example, you might be tempted to write ""Click *File* on the menu bar."" Better instructional syntax is ""From the menu bar, select *File*."" This helps the reader establish the region before the action and not the other way around. 

Continuing the example with an additional step and the outcome: ""From the menu bar, select *File* then *Open*. This launches the 'Open file' dialog box.""

This may seem overly simplistic, but when you delve into complicated procedures, it really helps the learners stay on the path. For example: ""Near the bottom of the screen, in the 'Parameters' section, select the ""Reset on exit"" radio button then click the Filter button (it looks like a yellow funnel).""

Of course, your instructions should be in numbered steps. I only use paragraph style to concentrate on the language part. If you have an example of a poorly written set of instructions, post it here and I'll show you how to re-write it."

481,LifeProTips,"LPT: If you are healthy, or cannot afford a good health insurance plan, buy the absolute cheapest one you can find. Details inside","It is fairly easy to find a health plan that is very affordable because it has a giant deductible. I am talking $5000-$20,000 deductible for $50-$100 a month

Even though you have a giant deductible, which means you will be paying for all your bills until you hit that deductible, you will still benefit from the HUGE discounts the insurance company has negotiated with the hospital/doctors.

For example, I had a PET scan done. The retail charge, the amount billed to the insurance (and how much a non insured patient would be billed) was $8500. My insurance company's ""Negotiated Rate"" was $846. That was the amount applied to my deductible, and the only thing the hospital could bill me for.  

So in short, even though you may be paying for most of your bills, you will benefit greatly from the giant discount insurance companies have, and as long as you go to an ""in network"" provider, they have to honor those discounts. And as a plus, if you do have a catastrophic illness, you will meet your giant deductible pretty quickly and then have the insurance kick in.

*edit*
You also benefit from having access to the insurance company ""rules"" that doctors have to follow. For example, if you walk into a Lab to have blood tested, you will get billed a charge for drawing the blood and a charge for each test done. Under most insurance, the blood draw fee is considered ""incidental"", meaning, its included in the cost of doing the  blood test, so the blood draw fee gets denied, and they cannot bill you for that.

**EDIT**
I just wanted to share a copy of a typical EOB (explanation of benefits) from some MRI's I had. As you can see, I had to pay the entire negotiated rate since my deductible was not met. If I did not have insurance, I would be responsible for the entire amount, or perhaps get a 10-20% discount for paying in full. My discount here is nearly 90%.

498,LifeProTips,Try this trick the next time you order pizza for delivery (makes for better pizza) [cross post from r/food],"If you want the best experience in pizza delivery, have them NOT cut the pizzas. Cut the pizzas after delivery using any utensil available (Star Trek Pizza etc.) and you'll notice a huge improvement in quality.

The reason is because when you cook a pizza, the water in each ingredient rises to the top of the pizza and forms a pool of water. The amount of water depends on the type and quantity of ingredients so ingredients like shrimp, pineapple and most meats will have the most water content. When they cut it right after cooking, the water goes into the cuts and the crust absorbs the water making the toppings slide when you take a slice. If you wait until the pizza is at home and in one piece, the water has time to evaporate. Now when you cut it, there is no water and the toppings stay put and everything tastes better because it's not watered down.

Been doing this for years and will never go back.

499,LifeProTips,"LPT: Kids asking ""How far?"" on a long road trip? Teach them how mile markers work.","I tried this with my 7YO daughter today and it worked like a charm.  She spent the rest of the trip to Grandma's House counting down to landmarks (miles to Grandma's state's line, miles to Grandma's city, miles to the exit, etc)....instead of asking me, ""How long until we get there?"" every fifteen seconds.

Edit - For those asking, here's how mile markers work: http://www.in.gov/indot/2488.htm

Also, I do have GPS (I don't live under a rock, *jeez*).  But my kids can't see it in the back seat, so this is a way for them to see how far we have to go without asking me."

501,LifeProTips,LTP: Back to School,"I went to college for an entire decade to get a doctorate and I am now a college professor at a major university. I feel I have learned a few things about being in and around university life. Here are my best tips. Feel free to add your own.

**Class schedule:**

One of the most important things needed in order to be successful in college life is to have your schedule set in the way that will be most beneficial to your lifestyle. Have trouble getting up in the mornings? DO NOT schedule an 8:00 am class; don't fool yourself into thinking that you will start getting up this semester. The reason universities offer classes at varying times is to allow students with different lifestyles to be successful. Sometimes, however, certain classes (especially courses within a major) are only offered at one time.

Look up where your classes are. Make sure that you have time in between classes to travel, eat lunch, and have some personal time. Don't pack all your classes back to back. Many freshmen in college do this since that is the way they have done school their entire lives. College is different. Give yourself some time in between classes.

Schedule in time to workout, eat, study/do homework, and personal time. This is often neglected. Once you get busy, all the things that you plan on doing ""when I have time"" will not happen. Put them in your planner/calendar.

Diligently use the calendar app on your phone/iPod/tablet/computer or buy a calendar book. Write down your classes and assignments. Write down social engagements as well. You may have been able to remember everything in high school, but there will come a time where your brain is so full that you simply can't remember everything. Write it down!

**Food**

If you are living in dorms and eating dorm food, try new things. Understand that not everything will be mind-blowing, but some things will work well for you. For example: Is it better for you/your body to just have cereal, fruit, and a yogurt for breakfast instead of waiting in the hot food line and getting sausage, bacon, pancakes, etc every morning.

If you live off campus and will be buying your own groceries: make sure to make regular trips to the grocery store. Don't be caught without food, forcing you to get fast food. This seems convenient, but is less healthy and is much more expensive than buying groceries. If you will be on campus all day, make a sandwich and take it with you. This isn't as exciting as getting food out, but you will save hundreds of dollars a year with just a little planning.

**Parking**

Parking on campus can be very, very expensive. Learn where the free places to park are. There are often places only a few blocks away where you can park on the street for free. Be willing to walk a few blocks or take a bus in order to save a lot of money. Parking where I teach costs close to $400 per year if you buy the campus pass. I found a free place to park and I take the bus into campus. It takes me about ten more minutes each way, but saving $400 is worth twenty minutes a day. I use this time to do some reading on my Kindle or answer emails on my phone.

**Bathrooms**

Every campus has good bathrooms and bad bathrooms. The bad bathrooms are usually in the dorms and close to class rooms. The good bathrooms are by administrative offices and offices that bring in lots of guests, such as the International Student Center. Explore. Find the best bathrooms; you'll be glad you did.

Carry a little toilet paper or wipes with you. Not all toilet paper is created equally. Campus toilet paper is some of the worst TP on the planet. I'm not even sure how it qualifies as TP.

**Quarters**

Quarters are one of the most prized commodities in university life. You'll need them for laundry, vending machines, parking, photocopies, and playing quarters (do people still play quarters?!)

**Try New Things**

The first couple weeks of college are very exciting - you meet new people, you are in a new place, and you learn new things. After the first month most people settle into a pattern. Buck this trend and keep things exciting by doing one thing a week you don't normally do. Eat somewhere new - try local places; go to a concert, dance performance, or play (these are often free on campus; go to the theater on campus (if there is one) and see an art film; go to a sporting event of a sport you don't normally watch. Try new things all the time. You may be surprised with what you enjoy.

**Professors**

Professors are generally intelligent people. Don't try to bullshit them. Be honest. Instead of fabricating some story about why you missed a test, be honest. I would rather have a students say ""I screwed up and forgot,"" than making something up. I am more apt to give honest students a second chance that those that I feel are trying to slip one by me.

Get to know your professors. Visit them during office hours if you need help. You may feel like you don't want to bother them, but believe it or not, most professors got into the profession because they want to see people interested in the same subject they are interested in.

Get to know your professors, but keep a healthy professional relationship. Do not call their cell phone or text them. Only use their official university email and office phones.

**Roommates**

Communicate about schedules before school starts. There is nothing worse that waking up for the first day of classes and have someone be in the shower when you need it. Try to have a good idea of their schedule so that you don't step on each other's toes.

Clean up after yourself. Most roommate trouble starts with dishes left around the apartment or in the sink. Take a few seconds to clean up after yourself; it goes a long way.

Do something unexpected for your roommates once a month. Cook them a meal, pick up something at the grocery store because you know they like it, etc. 

**Common Campus Courtesies**

Take off your headphones when people are talking to you.

Open a door for someone.

Keep your head up and smile at those around you. Too many students walk around with their head pointed at the ground.

Please, for the love of all that is holy, let people off the bus before you get on.

Help someone that needs help in a class.

Help someone that is handicapped - open a door, carry books, etc. 

Throw your garbage in the garbage can and recycle when possible. It's your campus and your home for the next several years.

These are just a few thoughts. Please leave your own in the comments. Good luck going back to school!

**EDIT:**

**Textbooks**

DO NOT buy textbooks at the university bookstore if possible. Try the local competitor or Amazon. 

Take classes with a roommate and split the cost of a book.

Check to see if the library has your text. I found this out my junior year of undergrad. The library had a copy of every class I took. I was the first to check the book out (a week or two before classes) and kept renewing the book throughout the semester.

**EDIT 2:**

I know I got the acronym wrong. Thanks to the eighty people that pointed it out.

**EDIT 3**

Forgot a big one. Change your sheets every week. If you are expecting ""company,"" change them that day.

**EDIT 4**

Several responses have been along the line of ""LPT: Don't go to college."" I think we can be more accepting than that. May I propose a new method of thinking when it comes to education?

Get the education you need for the career you want.

If this means medical school, then do it. If this means enlist in the army, don't go to college. If this means you want to be a college professor, grad school it is. Have the courage to try to live your dream. College/university isn't for everyone, but for those with specific goals in mind (that would be benefitted by a college degree), go to school and work hard.

503,LifeProTips,LPT: Imagine each new person you meet is your future best friend,"I'm shy by nature and not very good with casual converstation, especially with new people. This quick brain hack helped me, so here's my pay-it-forward. In the same vein of smiling before you answer the phone, assuming rapport with stranger immediately puts you in a positive attitude. Before you even speak your body language changes, you smile naturally, and the back-and-forth dialogue turns effortless. Since this is your new potential best friend, you automatically treat him/her with genuine respect and care about what they are saying.

**edit**: A bit of clarification on this LPT. This is not meant for every person you come in contact with (i.e. the cashier at the 7/11). I meant, generally-speaking, when being introduced to new people at parties or new co-workers at the office, etc. Secondly, it's a tip to overcome shyness at early introductions for *people who need it*. It's not for everyone. And lastly, assuming a rapport doesn't mean you'll instantly help a stranger with a cash loan or move his furniture to his new apartment, it just allows a comfortable kick start to a good first impression."
510,LifeProTips,LPT: Picking up people at the airport? Have them meet you at Departures instead of Arrivals,Traffic is much lighter and moves much more quickly in the Departures area compared to Arrivals.

513,LifeProTips,"LPT: Ladies, when trying on swimsuit bottoms, make sure the fabrics tight around the bum. The fabric will stretch a half size bigger once you get in the water (the classic baggy bum look).","Worked for a high end swim suit store. 

If debating between a large and a medium for example, opt for the medium if its still relatively comfortable. The uninterrupted fabric for the bum suffers the most from water bagging (which is why this doesn't apply for bikini tops).

(I have more swimsuit lpt's if wanted- for men too.)

Edit: Also why I recommend side tie bikini bottoms for women who don't buy swimsuits very often. Side tie will help you control the tightness as the swimsuit wears. 

Edit2: FOR EVERYONE, PLEASE DO NOT DRY YOUR SWIMWEAR IN THE DRYER. The heat will fuck hard core with the lycra (pulling, twisting, thins your fabric). MEN TOO: those board shorts aren't meant for the dryer. And please if you can, hand wash. You can fill your sink up, put some detergent (there are also great $3 swim wear detergents that actually work) and let it soak for a bit. Then rinse. It'll really lengthen your swimwear lifespan.

Thanks all for making this a highly visible tip. My message as a first responder (firefighter): If you're not first aid trained, **book in to get trained, now!** It's easy, doesn't take long (a weekend at most) and gives you the skills to save lives. Emergencies happen without warning, I know from experience. Knowing what to do and how to delegate tasks during an emergency will dramatically improve the victims chances of survival. 

**Get trained. Do not put it off. You do not want to regret putting off your first aid course if a friend or a loved one needs your skills and focus.**

Regarding liability: **check your local laws** as this varies by state and country. Almost all jurisdictions have 'good will' or 'good samaritan' legislation that waives liability for assistance rendered in an emergency. If in doubt: **always call an ambulance/render assistance if able**.

**First aid trainers**

* [St. John Ambulance Australia](http://www.stjohn.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=25)

Orangered me more trainers if you know of any.

--------------------------------------------

Seems strange, though is true. The rhythm beat in [""Stayin' Alive""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_izvAbhExY) is the correct rate of compression to give to a heart attack victim.

Play the song in your head, or get someone to play it on their phone for you **after you've asked how far the ambulance is away** - this both ensures that someone has actually *called* an ambulance **and** gives you a estimated time of paramedics arrival. 

One other thing: **press hard**, with **locked arms**. CPR shown on TV shows and movies where the first aider's arms bend during compressions is **incorrect** and is most definitely not hard enough.

Effective compressions are 1/3rd of the way into an adult victims chest. Don't be afraid to break bones. A few cracked ribs are a much better alternative to death.

Keep calm and keep compressing until paramedics take over.

* [Vinnie Jones' ad on this technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILxjxfB4zNk) (for UK redditors, includes signs symptoms and explanation of technique)

LPT2: If you're not first aid trained (or at the very least CPR trained), **do it**. It's easy and equips you with the skills to save lives.

Rules in this sub-reddit advise against giving medical advice. Screw it. This is a vital skill that **everyone** should know how to do in a pinch and does save lives.

It has saved me plenty of times when I get stuck at work late, or just want to do a once over before I knock on the door.  Just some basic stuff I keep in mine, as an example:
*Comb
*Listerine strips
*Small sample tubes of my most frequently worn colognes
*Chapstick
*small mirror
*$30 (in case of calling a cab home, etc)
*Whisp (single use toothbrush thing)
*Nail file
*Tissues
* Allergy meds, tylenol, medications
*Box of condoms (because you really cant cary more than one in a wallet)
*Bottle of wine (in the trunk): you never know when you are going to be invited home with someone...

Ladies, obviously would probably want a makeup compact, etc, but I would assume you have purses for that :-)  I'd love input on what a woman might want in there though.  Having this stuff has saved me many times I was running late, and it is always a good confidence boost to check yourself right before you dive into a date.  Other helpful things from my other car kits that have been helpful are:
*flashlight (lady looses an earring, etc)
*gauze pad (for a lady wearing new, unbroken-in shoes)
*umbrella, in case of inclement weather

EDIT: wow, thanks for all the replies and tips.  I got a lot of good tips (thanks for all the ""NO dont keep condoms in your car if its hot!).  It was especially interesting to hear the female equivalent, although again, you guys get a purse to cary with you (so jealous of this boon).  For those that say this type of thing is trying to hard, or creepy, to each their own (or, ""haters gonna hate,"" whichever you prefer).  I wouldnt post this if it hadnt been working out well for me, and again, lots of it (umbrella, gauze for shoe blisters, etc) is actually to make sure she is comfortable.

527,LifeProTips,LPT: Rather than 'not finishing your plate' learn what a correct portion size is and stick to it,"Portion size is something I think most people over-estimate.

[This is a link to WebMD's breakdown of portion sizes](http://www.webmd.com/diet/healthtool-portion-size-plate) - this is geared more for weight control/management, so take it with a pinch of salt (or without, if you're high in blood pressure - yeah, that's a little joke for y'all)

545,LifeProTips,"LPT: Getting rid of flies en masse, in less than an hour","I see a lot of tips here on fly traps and fruit fly traps, which are pretty effective.  However, they do take some time to complete work.

**Boil vinegar.**

A few weeks ago over at a friend's house, I was cooking dinner.  Part of it was a Balsamic reduction, which I needed a lot of (many people).  We'd had the windows and doors of the house open all day because it was warm, and there were probably 10-15 flies meandering around the down stairs as well as the upstairs.

As soon as the vinegar fumes hit the air, they starting dropping out of the sky like they'd been sprayed by raid.  They weren't stunned, they were dead.  As the fumes spread, the ones upstairs died too.

Today, I came home from work to find a small cloud of horse flies in my living room (probably about 10 of them, but those assholes are huge).  I opened the back door to see if they'd go OUT, but more came IN.  My neighbor's garbage was apparently infested.

I figured I was having pasta and beef for dinner anyway, so I'd see if the vinegar worked again.  I started simmering some Balsamic... and lo and behold, they all died within 10 minutes.  I swept them out the door.

Yes, your house is going to smell like vinegar for a few hours, but that's easily aired out.

**TL;DR Simmer or boil vinegar on your stove.  The fumes will kill flies almost immediately.**

553,LifeProTips,"I've worked at grocery stores for my entire adult life from stocking shelves, to brokerage sales, to distribution and I learned a little trick to buying ""store brand"" items. [x-post from /r/frugal]","**Hey, [/r/lifeprotip](/r/lifeprotip) -ers, I was told to cross post this here, I don't read this subreddit often, so if this is not acceptable or bad material, please accept my apologies and have the mods remove it**

So, I've always worked with fresh departments (meat, deli, bakery, produce) so that is where my example is going to come from. 

Store brand items are rarely made by 'cheaper' companies in grocery chains.  Usually a large brand will repackage the store brand item so they can get more items and facings in the store and preferential treatment from corporate buyers when selling new items (or even discounted/waved slotting fees, which is huge).  The ingredients of the store brand item won't be EXACTLY the same as the name brand BUT it will still have the same level of quality, which is what a lot of people are worried about when buying store brand.

OK, on to the trick.  I'm sorry if most people already know this in [/r/frugal](/r/frugal) **(now [/r/lifeprotips](/r/lifeprotips)!)** but no one I have talked to has, so I'm sharing it.

Lets say I'm having a cookout and need to buy bratwurst but the high quality Johnsonville Brats are 2 dollars more expensive per pack than the store brand and I need to keep prices low but keep the quality of my meats for the BBQ high (so my friends don't think I'm a cheap ass... but the PBR might give that away...).

[Here is a picture of a package of Johnsonville Brats](http://i.imgur.com/phH8p.jpg) Do you see the small circle above ""Previously handled frozen for your protection, refreeze or refrigerate""?  That is the serial number for the factory/slaughterhouse where the meat was packaged (in this case 34225).  **edit 3** FDA regulation, all meat products are marked with serial number so you know where they came from in case of contamination.

Even the biggest names only have handful of places that will package their product and (usually) only one that will handle the grocery chains in your region.  That location will also handle/package the store brand items.  

SO, match the serial number on a name brand meat product that you know to be quality with the store brand meat product of a similar type.  If they are the same, you have found who actually makes the store brand item.  It takes a little while to find out exactly who is making what, but it will save you money if you are looking for quality along with low prices.

**edit** Someone in [/r/frugal](/r/frugal) said this was like excessive coupon cutting, meaning that is wasted time for not much money saved.  I disagree, if you pick up a meat item weekly it really isn't hard to look at the store brand 5 feet away and compare serial numbers.  If the same company you are loyal to makes it!  Awesome, you can buy store brand instead and enjoy the same quality.

**edit 2** P.S. I've worked with 8 grocery chains (actually in their stores/offices) in 9 states in 3 regions, and the best?

567,LifeProTips,LPT: Keep olive oil in the shower,"I always keep a bottle of Costco-sized olive oil in the shower. It is a great skin moisturizer, and if you have run out of face wash, olive oil does a better trick than any of them. For both uses, you only need maybe half a capful to oil your body with, and less than a few drops to wash your face, which means you're going to be far more economical than if you were buying individual products.

Also, if you decide to have a bath, pour in a capful and walk out with the silkiest skin imaginable. Bonus: you learn what it's like to be spaghetti.

Final use, if you have a safety razor (one with a removable razor blade), olive oil makes fantastic shaving oil and gets you a really close, smooth shave. 

Best part of this all? Olive oil is cheaper and goes a lot farther than buying all those bath products combined.

572,LifeProTips,LPT: How to avoid being d0xed,"**Alternate title: how to keep your real identity private online.**

As [requested](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11j1o6/violentacrez_comes_back_from_the_dead_as_mbrutsh/c6mx7yi), here is some information on how to avoid being d0xed.  This has happened to multiple redditors recently, with Violentacrez being the most famous example, but other users of NSFW subreddits, and SRS, have also been d0xed in the last 72 hours, even though that hasn't been widely publicized.  I mostly lurk on this site, but I see this recent d0xing trend as a major problem.  I hope the comments on this post deal mostly with how to harden one's online profile, instead of degenerating into ""who's right"" in any of the recent dramafests.

As a first point, my title is a lie.  If you do anything online, there is always a trail.  An entity with enough resources, time, and interest can always document your personal identifying information (known as d0xing in hacker slang).  So, for example, I think it is safe to assume that the NSA can connect any username I've ever used on any site to my real identity.  They may not have bothered to do it yet, because I doubt I'm a person of interest to them, but they likely have all the data stored to connect the dots if they needed to.

Most users of this site aren't political activists though.  They are people who would probably prefer that their employers/parents/church not know about their requests for relationship advice, their comments about sexual practices, or the humiliating story they posted on Ask Reddit.  I'm going to provide some information and key links that will (probably) protect you to that extent.  The Reddit Admins might still be able to figure out who you are, but a nosy fellow Redditor won't.

General Tips:

1. **Google every username you've ever used.**  (Also use Bing, Yahoo, Ask, etc.  I'll just say Google from now on.)  This includes handles on message boards, IM, and dating sites.  Close or make private all profiles that come up, so an attacker cannot cross-reference from site to site to get more information about you.

2. Delete your MySpace, Facebook, LinkedIn or at least set them to ridiculously private.  This includes setting it so that people cannot find you through search or search-by-email.  If you need LinkedIn for work, invite people directly.  Don't allow your identifying information to be visible to friends (or at least premium members).  [LinkedIn is a hacker's dream tool](http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/12/technology/linkedin-hackers/index.htm).  The same is true about Facebook.

3. Use multiple online usernames, and compartmentalize what each is for.  For example, on Reddit, use one username to create and moderate subreddits, another to surf NSFW content, and another to post in the default subs.  Also, it's best to scrub your content history regularly, and/or to throw away old usernames and start anew on a regular schedule, such as the first of every month.  These usernames should not be obviously connected to one another (""name001"" and ""name 002"" would not be a good choice).  You can always PM your friends saying that you're using the new name, so people you trust will know.  To make switches from name to name easier, I recommend installing a [password manager](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2381432,00.asp).

4. [Remove your personal information](http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/02/remove-personal-information-from-the-internet/) from the major search engines and databases.  There are a lot more than Google, including some you've never heard of, like Spokeo.  This link provides a list containing most of them.

Good luck, and stay safe.

573,LifeProTips,LPT: Deal with annoying recurring thoughts,"Ever have those annoying thoughts or songs in your head that won't go away? Put them to work for you. Mentally associate the thought with a habit or behavior you want to change like good posture, breathing, or remembering to relax your shoulders.

That way, when the annoying thought comes back around (and believe me, it will) you can get some use out of it. Hope it helps!

584,LifeProTips,LPT: Save money when grocery shopping; don't assume that bigger=cheaper,"Supermarkets are well aware that most people assume buying products in bulk is cheaper. It's true for the most part, but they will exploit this. There may be products in store where buying two small boxes can actually work out cheaper than one big box. Two examples i've seen recently are washing up liquid and laundry detergent, in Dunnes Stores and Tesco (Ireland)

unfortunately it can hurt your head trying to work out the price per weight and comparing almost every product you buy, but if you have time and are trying to save money then do this!


Another reason not to buy in bulk, is when you see something like 5 bars of chocolate on sale. Don't buy them thinking ""oh they'll last me 5 days/weeks etc"", because you're more likely to just give into temtpation and eat them all in one sitting..."
587,LifeProTips,LPT How to effectively use Incognito Mode for sites other than porn.,"Let's all be honest here, incognito mode is known to be 'porn' mode. But there are other very useful purposes for it. A few I know off hand is if you are on a friends computer or on a Mac at the apple store, open up incognito to do your facebooking or tweeting. Also you can check your email among other sites that require a login. This way, when you close the browser, it's as if you were never there. 

Popular belief (or fact) is that airlines charge you more if they see you browsing flights before you actually book one. Open up incognito mode if you want to browse flights and you'll be smooth sailing, ...errr or flying.

Please feel free to name other sites or reasons, besides porn, incognito can be utilized to its full potential!

---------------------------------------
Edit2: Incognito is a feature for the Google Chrome Browser. Almost every (if not every) browser has this feature but it is called other names. Firefox has inPrivate Browsing, IE has Private Browsing, etc. 

---------------------------------------
Edit1.3: List of Uses for Incognito mode:

* First and foremost, porn

* Log into a second website (second login for reddit, gmail, gf's facebook, etc.)

* ~~Check amazon prices (apparently they raise the price? Needs verification)~~

* View facebook and other social media on public computers (Read the blurb at the bottom)

* View email on public computer (Samsies as above)

* Quick logout when you exit the browser.  Useful for banks, emails, facebook, etc.

* Check airline prices (without computer saving your cookies thus jacking up airline costs (yes this is true, there is multiple articles around reddit that talks on this subject including LPTs and AMAs to name a few))

* Disabling Extensions on the fly for sites that don't cooperate (News for example)

* News sites like after you hit the article limit on NY times, the paywall on the Daily Telegraph, Hacker News has a anti-procrastination time delay

* If you want an unbiased google search result (google tailors based on previous searches)

* Online shopping for SO or friend that uses the computer so they can't see what you got them

* Double printing coupons.  (Some sites monitor if you have been there)

* Use it on a friends laptop to keep the out of your history

* See how your facebook looks to the public

* View LinkedIn profiles without people knowing you visited them

* Private browsing in general


------------------------------------------
Edit3: Gee Wilikers there are a lot of comments. I'll update the above lists after work. (Central Standard Time)

------------------------------------------
Edit4:  And lastly yes, watch out for keyloggers, malware and traffic monitors.  For top notch security, type your password in sections by using your mouse move to locations within the password... or use the on screen keyboard (start-&gt;run-&gt;osk).  These are extra precautions on truly 'public' computers to beat 'primitive' keyloggers.  (see u/WK_of_Angmar and u/SanityInAnarchy 's reply for more details.  I have not verified this)  Also note that your ISP still knows the sites you access and the IT guy, in some cases, will too.  Don't think incognito is fool proof at work."

One other thing I thought of was telling your resolution to someone else that will be excited for you! This will be great and helpful because when you are plannin on taking that extra slice of cake, you'll remember that so-and-so will be askin you about it later, and you might re-think your decision.

Some info inside, please comment for other suggestions.","A screen will give your brain the same idea as sunlight, so avoiding looking at any screens for an hour before you try and sleep will help significantly. Although there are alternatives: 

For your PC, you can change the colours with a free program called [F.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/). Apparently this works on iOS devices also.

I use a combination of Lux and Tasker to automatically turn my phone into night mode at night. This isn't free, but I'm sure there are free alternatives.

* Going to bed an hour earlier with some music on, with a sleep timer so you don't have to worry about it.

596,LifeProTips,"A way to increase your happiness, day by day.","My first post, so i hope this is the right place to post it:

I would like to tell you about a way that can increase your happiness, day by day.
For a long time, i have been feeling unhappy about my life. 
However, i recently decided that it was time to turn the unhappiness, into happiness.

The tools i used for this was a pen and a block of paper.
Every night, before going to sleep, i sit down by my bed table, and i write down the good things that have happened to me during the day.
I have started writing down even the smallest event, as long as they made me feel happy, or good about myself.

An example: 
2. March 2013
- Played the guitar again
- Had a pizza with my good friend
- Had a good talk with mom on the phone

You can put down as many things on the list as you'd like.
However there might be days where you feel unhappy, and you dont feel that you have anything to write at all.
Whenever this happens, read the list of good things you have written so far.
By every day there will be more added to the list, and there will be more good things to help you cheer up again.
Be careful that it doesnt just turn into a diary. Write only the things that made you feel happy and good about yourself.

I have been doing this for 3 months now, and it has made me a lot happier, and helped me when i was feeling down.
I hope that this can be a tool to help any of you that feel unhappy, to become happier."

600,LifeProTips,LPT: Personal fix on nail biting,"I bit my nails for my entire life, (I'm 19 now) and I always wanted to stop, but had failed with every single method. I adapted to the horrible tasting stuff, the method where you leave one alone, then another, etc until you've stopped. That never worked for me, because I started doing it subconsciously. It took the proper motivation for me to get my head down and think. For me, as a metalhead, it was the Download festival 2012. Holy fuck, I couldn't miss that. So my parents said they'd buy me a ticket. If I stopped once and for all. Fuck. 
So I came up with the solution. I thought, I can't rely on substances, I can't count on my ability. So the only thing left was to remove the chance. The next day I bought some medical tape and bound up every finger. I didn't just bite the nails, I had removed the skin on every finger up to the mid-joint. (It was vile) I replaced it daily, wore gloves when I could.  Once you remove the ability to bite, you remove the habit. I stopped. But I wasn't convinced, so I began to remove the tape finger by finger over the course of a few weeks. I didn't bite them. For the first time in 19 years I could cut my nails. The Whole process took about a few months, then a few weeks for the unravelling. I couldn't tell if my parents were happy or sad. I'd done something they'd been trying to do for years, and now they had to fork over £200 for a ticket. I was extremely grateful, and download was fucking awesome.
So that's it really. Get yourself some motivation and some tape. 

EDIT: well this has taken off, many thanks for the congrats and the extra knowledge for the biters still fighting the battle. I'm gonna throw in other things that have been known to help and i may or may not have done. 

-Hypnotherapy    I was about to have this done, not sure if it's a definite fix, but may be different for people. A gentleman tried it below and i don't think he had a massive effect. And it's quite expensive, so this would be a last resort. 

-Rubber band technique-   Another gentleman (JC_BOOM_) turned himself into the pavlovs dog of the biting world, he put a band round his wrist and snapped it everytime he was biting. Untill he associated the whole thing with pain, a few relapses,but putting the band on seems to be the trick.

-getting your friends/family/co-workers to kick your ass into submision-  I tired this, telling everybody to punch you if you're biting. It didn't work for me, but worth a shot!

-meth- juhesihcaaa has stated that a woman in a gas station told her she stopped after she took meth. Every      little helps I guess. (I'm not actually condoning drug use)

-Chew something else- keep yourself occupied, toothpick, chewing gum, cats teeth. Whatever takes your fancy. it keeps your mouth occupied. 

TL;DR
Get tape. Tape yourself. Unravel slowly. A few months. Stop. Be a badass.

It cut itself off in mid-sentence, apologized, and in about 10 more seconds I was talking to an Apple tech. Unfortunately for me, he couldn't help me order my new keyboard. At least I got the answer that they aren't made anymore, instead of having to drive over an hour to the closest Apple store for the same information."

EDIT: ok people there seems to be people who don't get why I'm doing this, so ill explain it up here... I do not condone breaking the law. Pay attention when your driving. Don't run a red light. However, I have seen fines up to a thousand dollars for running a red light, that's rent money. That's food on the table. Im not trying to help people break the law or do it more often, I'm trying to help people not get robbed blind by our government.

Alright here it is people. I'm a cop. I think that tickets have turned into a way, for the most part, for the city/state to tax the citizens. That's not the role of a police officer. So ill give advice where I can on how to avoid getting them. A red light camera ticket. Prevention is best. If you know you are about to run a red light on accident, look away. Cover your face. Do whatever you can to make your face unrecognizable to the camera. The burden is on the court to prove that it is you. When you get the ticket (and you will) just state that there is not sufficient evidence to prove that it is you in the vehicle. (if your face is covered/blurred there is not) they will ask you who was in the vehicle. You do not have to tell them. The burden is on the court to prove your guilt, not for you to prove your innocence. Also another handy way is if your. Married and you and your spouse drive different cars, register the opposite spouse's name to each car. They issue the ticket to the registered owner. If your married and your spouse is the registered owner of the car you normally drive, you can just say that you are clearly not the registered owner and get out of it that way also.

If anyone has any other questions on how to get out of petty things like traffic tickets..let me know ill try to help

Avoid mess, pests, smell and washing dishes - with one simple tip.","Train yourself to only use one piece of crockery (a plate and a bowl),  one piece of cutlery (a spoon, a knife, a fork) and one mug and drinking glass. Then either you wash them straight after use, or you're forced to clean them before use.

This might sound obvious and not worthy of being a 'pro tip' in theory; but in reality it's a practice that's difficult to execute at first, as when you're hungry or thirsty it's too easy to take the easy-option, but if you train your self to observe the rule, it becomes genius.

We fall into grooves living with others, of always getting a new plate, or a new bowl out of the cupboard every single time. When living alone with no-one to wash the dishes to appease, we get sloppy and let things pile up until we're forced to tidy and clean; this can lead to catastrophe, cockroaches love dat standing water...

If when living alone you stick by the rule that the plate you use is the only plate you use, and the fork and spoon that you eat with are your only mistresses, you save your self so much fucking hassle. Also if you're living in shared accommodation, think of how many arguments this would get you out of!

I always get annoyed when the pen stops writing, but not because its out of ink, it just starts to sort of slide, but it won't write. The ink simply won't come out. 

**LPT:** *put a piece of paper underneath your hand, to make sure that your arm does not rest on the exact same paper you're writing on*. See, when your hand comes into contact with the paper, it transfers some of the natural grease and minerals, which cover our skin. The ball inside of the pen simply starts to slide on top of that grease, not revolving, thus not getting more ink out. 

This isn't based on any research or anything. This is just my observation from college years. 

**TL;DR:** put a piece of paper under your writing hand to make sure that the hand does not come into contact with the paper you're writing on. The paper is less filthy and prevents pen sliding.

To keep the mold from coming back, when you pick up that Odoban, also pick up a pack of Damp Rid (or DIY it, if ya know how). These are basically a plastic bag with some kind of sand-like compound that attracts moisture out of the air and deposits it in another compartment. this keeps the moisture from forming mold.

I've been struggling with constant fatigue (pretty much every day) for the past few years and I decided that it has to do with my lifestyle, so I made some changes - I've changed my diet (now paleo), started working out every other day of the week (cycling, swimming, cardio) but nothing seemed to help in a significant way.

Fast forward to around 2 months ago, I've had my routine check-up, including an eye exam. I've been told that I have astigmatism, and that I'll have to wear glasses to correct my vision.

Ever since I received the glasses (and actually started wearing them :) ), the fatigue subsided. Fast forward to now (around a month and a half since I got my glasses), and my life has almost turned around 180 degrees - I feel as if I'm reborn. No more headaches, no more fatigue ever since I wake up, no more oversleeping, I even stopped drinking coffee/yerba mate. Life's good :)!

I bet you're thinking ""My vision isn't THAT bad"" - Hell, mine isn't bad either, I'm only at -0.5 and -1, it's mostly the astigmatism that screws me up.

**tl;dr** If you're feeling tired very often, get your eyes checked. Your bad eyesight might be the culprit!


EDIT: To those dismissing my tip.. it's just friendly advice. I realise that many people adapt to their eyesight issues and may never realise that it could be the problem - I'm just throwing the idea out there for them. Never did I say that it's solution for every person suffering from fatigue."
648,LifeProTips,The REAL quick fix to get your fucked up sleep schedule back on track,"Look below for the quick fix, here is my preface:

I say ""real"" because I first want to warn you about a quick fix technique that does NOT work.

The ""wrap around"" technique is where you stay up all night until, say, 10pm the next day. You force yourself to go to bed at 10pm from then on.

This doesn't work. If you stay up all night you get ""sleep debt"" and you  will end up requiring more sleep in the following days to pay back your sleep debt. Sleep debt is a real phenomenon that has been discussed in academic journals. FYI If you oversleep one night you cannot expect to be able to sleep less the next night. There are no rollover hours. But if you don't get enough sleep one night you WILL have to repay those hours over the course of the following nights. This is why the wrap around technique is a myth. I have tried it over 10 times and failed over 10 times.  

**HERE IS THE QUICK FIX**

Stop eating. Right now. *Fast* until the time when you want to wake up, say, 7am. Go to sleep whenever you want but force yourself to wake up at 7am. 

At 7am go to a window where you can see the sun and look at it (not directly! but get the sun in your field of vision). Then eat a complete, healthy breakfast.

You can survive 3 weeks without eating so it won't do you any permanent damage to fast until 7am.

Your circadian rhythm is mostly affected by two things:

1.) Sunlight

2.) Meal timings

Even ancient roman philosophers (I'm thinking of Epictetus the Stoic) said that one must first control his eating habits, and then he must control his sleeping habits, (then he controls his sexual desires!)

I have found it relatively easy to force myself to eat once at 7am, and not at all after dinner time. It's easier to change your eating habits than your sleeping habits. Once you change your eating habits your sleeping habits become much easier to change as well.

Also consider if you are getting enough exercise.


**TL;DR** Don't try to stay up all night. Stop eating right now and fast until your target wake-up time. Eat a large healthy breakfast and get some sunlight in your retina at that time. Repeat until sleep schedule has been fixed, it will take only** 1 or 2 days.**

*****

**EDIT** I read the comments and I would like to add some of the things that helpful redditors have mentioned.

Yes, you must force yourself to wake up in the morning. But the point is that it is *easier* to do this if you are hungry and *even easier* as the days go on (by day 3 you might wake up with no alarm clock naturally feeling refreshed). After the first morning your belly will wake you up naturally, expecting a meal. Just like how my cat wakes me up in the morning expecting a meal.

It's winter time so the sun rises late. Daylight savings times helps this however. If you still must rise before the sun consider buying a sun lamp.

Specifically BLUE light is what wakes you up. But any bright light source will stimulate your circadian cycle.

This technique is less effective if you body is used to sporadic meal times.

This technique is consistent with the old adage ""Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper."" However you might want to consider reading [this article](http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/top-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html) that attempts to debunk the adage.

Redditor ""ejactulator"" claims to be a physician and PhD student and vouches for this technique. He says he does it when he travels around the world to avoid jet lag. That is also how I learned of this technique. Instead of using it to cure jetlag, I applied it to cure a fucked up sleep schedule for any other reason.

Avoid using the internet or watching tv in the hour or two before you go to bed. Find another activity to do during that time that does not require looking at a bright screen.

Consider Melatonin supplements but they are not for everyone. If you suspect your body might not react well then talk to your doctor first.

Be warned that fasting slows down your metabolism and while I say above it will not cause you permanent damage, be wary if you have a condition like hypoglycemia.

652,LifeProTips,LPT: How to write an essay quickly and efficiently!,"I am a history major at a large university. Writing papers is practically all of my school work. I receive As on all my essays, except for the one time I got ten percent knocked off for forgetting the title (remember the title, please). Over time, I have discovered ways that you all may or may not know. This is obviously for research-based essays.

*I have made edits based on popular suggestions!*

* First of all, know your professor or the AI grading it. Write papers according to what they want.

* Organize your sources. If you are given a list of sources you can use, determine which book is a primary source or secondary source. The secondary source book (typically the textbook of the class if that is allowed) will be the basis of your essay. You will compliment it with primary sources and then embellish with a few points from lecture. *IF* your textbook is a real textbook (a book intended for covering a subject and published by a textbook publisher), then you never use it. If the books for your class are scholarly works by an individual (or sometimes two or three) professionals in the field, then you can use it. (That was what I meant by textbook).

* When you write, dig through the book for all the chapters covering your subject. Start off with that secondary source book and write from it. Go back and add in the primary sources or additional secondary sources, then embellish with lecture points. Focusing on one book initially helps you to get the point across and then you can go back and elaborate or add sources to get the page/word count.

* ~~Use your lectures as a source! Professors and the TAs that will most likely be grading the essay like seeing that you paid attention in class.~~ Only do this if the professor asks for it or you know it will be fine.

* If you cannot use your textbook, but you can use your own sources, find another book similar to your textbook. Mostly, this works for history papers. Can't use your *A History of the Roman People* textbook for the paper? Then use *History of Rome*.

* Do not waste time on footnotes when you are writing your essay. Instead, do this: If I am quoting from an author named Ward on page 232, type (w232). After you are done, go back and do your footnotes. Obviously, if you are using another author with the same last initial, make sure the include the first initial so you do not get confused and misattribute a quote. While trying to figure out the footnotes in Word, you can lose your momentum or a great idea.

* As for the dreaded length requirements: learn to be eloquent. I like to write fantasy stories, so this is a developed skill. Right now, I am being concise for obvious reasons.  Unless your professor allows it, do not quote entire paragraphs from your sources word for word. This makes it too obvious that you are doing your paper last minute. Instead, summarize what you read in your own words and then put in your citation after you have completed summarizing. This is the easiest way to gain length, since a research essay is just a collection of sources regurgitated into a coherent paper.

* Lastly, choose a topic with widely available information that is easy to understand. I was given a list for my Roman history paper with topics such as slavery, economics, and wars. While I love studying Roman warfare, it is a broad topic that is often confusing. Instead, I went with religion and culture. Why? The information is straightforward and easy to find. The aforementioned book *A History of the Roman People* has chapters dedicated to those subjects divided from the rest of the information, making it incredibly easy to find."
654,LifeProTips,"LPT needs to refocus on actual pro tips, not reminders to practice common sense or common courtesy.","  I have seen many ""protips"" about how to either have common courtesy or common sense.   Some examples from the current front page:

*  ""Do your homework""
* ""Eating things in moderation is good""
* ""Make sure put out plenty of whatever your guests need out before they come.""
* ""Don't be a giant mess when your landlord comes over"".  

I know these things might be news to some people, but there is no way you could think they're ""pro tip"".  

To me, if you are a professional in a field and have a tip that people out of the field probably don't know, that's what i was looking for.  

Are you a mechanic? You might want to tell people about how easy it is to diagnose a check engine light for OBD-I vehicles.

657,LifeProTips,LPT: Avoid driving over plastic grocery bags when its safe to do so. I am a professional mechanic and have seen first hand all the damage these bags can do. (Details inside).,"First off let me say, be safe out there! Avoid swerving dangerously at the sight of a bag. Check your mirrors and carefully change lanes to go around the bag. If you run one over watch your rear view mirror to see if the bag passed under your car and is still in the roadway. If not and its safe to do so, pull over and look under your car in a parking lot. 

As stated I am a professional mechanic and I see at least once a week a car come in with damage caused by a plastic grocery bag. Most people are completely unaware they hit the bag or that it was causing problems. 

Here is a list of problems plastic bags can cause. 


* Getting sucked into the drive belts and wrapping themselves around alternators, AC compressors, pulleys, etc. When they do this it can cause anything they are wrapped around to fail, leading to expensive repairs, and even a risk of fire. 


* Getting wrapped around half axles and destroying the axle boot and leading to axle failure. This is really common, the bag gets sucked up into the spinning axle and then wraps itself tightly around the rubber CV joint boot, and ends up tearing the boot allowing all the axle grease to escape and destroying the CV joint/axle. 


* Getting stuck to the exhaust system components and melting, causing burning smells inside the vehicle and sometimes fires. This is another really common problem. I have even seen a bag become stuck to the exhaust, catch fire, and then burn up the wiring on the O2 sensor. That resulted in a check engine light, and a costly repair for the vehicle owner. 


* Getting sucked into the torque converter, clutch area. This is pretty uncommon, but I have seen at least one example of this. 


This is just a quick short list. There are many more issues these bags can cause. And often its not cheap to repair and can lead to dangerous situations for the vehicle owners. 


So next time you are driving and see a bag floating across the roadway, try and avoid it.

Drinking through a straw makes the whole process so much easier. There's something about the suction that helps, the pill just disappears pretty much instantly (most of the time you don't even notice it passing).

For clarification since there seems to be comments about pills inside straws...

1. Put the pill on the middle/back of your tongue.
2. Then take a small straw bended at 90 degrees (either from a juice carton, in water or whatever beverage).
3. Drink. The sucking effect is like creating a tunnel in your mouth with the straw acting as a concentrated hose of sorts. Pushes it down easily."

666,LifeProTips,LPT: Always walk in like you own the place...,"Because someday you might. A business, a house, everywhere you go. Have respect for it, treat it as if it's yours, and keep it as clean as you can. You'll be developing etiquette and manners while building your own self-confidence.

**Edit:**

Number 1 in LPT. Cool.

Many of you are clearly going out of your way to askew its meaning. Most people associate the phrase ""walking around like he/she owns the place"" as a negative, that the person has a sense of entitlement to do whatever they want to because they are the owner. That's just being a douche. 

Think of a business you would like to run, or a place you would love to live in. How would you treat it? Would you act like a dick to your customers or to your tenants? Or would you treat everyone there with respect and a smile, because treating them that way creates a friendlier, more welcoming environment and stronger relationships?

The idea behind ""because someday you might"" is important because in the future you could be known as ""that person who *way back then* already started to make the place what it is today"" versus ""that person that pooped on the floor because he/she felt like it.""

Since this thread is already at the top, I understand most of you already get what I meant. This clarification if for the floor poopers."

**EDIT**

*tl;dr*

*My opinions and responses to several comments*

ok, so a bunch of people are saying ""get a gun"".  I'm an American, so that sentiment does make sense to me, but not every region of the world is going to feel that same way. Even here, there are plenty of people that won't/can't buy a firearm, that do have access to a vehicle.

While I think that a gun can provide a good sense of security, who is going to start shooting through doors and walls as soon as they hear something?  The people that say ""Me!"" are the ones, in my opinion, that shouldn't own a firearm.  You had be very damn sure that you want someone dead before you start pointing guns at them. 

Setting off a car alarm won't accidentally kill your neighbor, your spouse, your pet, or your kids sneaking back into the house.

I also agree that a home alarm system would be a better solution, but those aren't always available. They can be cost prohibitive, logistically problematic (I don't have a land line - things may have changed, but this used to be a requirement), or just plain not allowed. 

The people that say your neighbors are going to hate you if you do this... No they're not. If you're not an idiot, you're not going to be setting off the car alarm every 15 minutes, every night. If you are that kind of person, I hate to break it to you, but your neighbors probably already hate you. 

This LPT was just something that I saw on Facebook, shared through a local police department's page. This is not an an excuse to forgo all common sense, but I really was thinking of the people that may have reasons to be scared. 

Single parents? If you don't have kids, you might not get it, but you never want to leave them parentless. 

Alone and recovering? When do you feel the most helpless, if not when you're sick or hurt?

I'll even through out there, past victims of crimes. If someone has been traumatized by a crime, there's a good chance they'll be afraid of it happening again.

Maybe, just maybe, this would help them sleep through the night. 

Oh yeah, realistically, don't be a hero. Call the cops. Even if you're not sure, they'll come out and check it out. Keep your doors and windows locked at night, and if you can, keep an exterior light on."

713,LifeProTips,LPT: use oil to once and for all banish acne ridden skin,"I've suffered with acne since my late teen years, I'm now almost 30. I've tried just about every product on the market (aside from prescription) and never had any luck with any of them. 


I started doing some research, and found the Oil Cleansing Method, or OCM. It has been 2 years now since I started, and I have not had a single pimple since. So I thought I'd share with you, reddit!




**How it works**

We all know our skin produces natural oils. These oils hydrate and protect your skin. OCM works by daily replacing dirty oil with clean oil, rather than stripping the oil from your skin completely (which is what common cleansers do). 


**How to**


To make your oil cleanser you will need 3 things: Coconut oil, Castor Oil (found in the laxatives section of your pharmacy), and a clean bottle to store it in.


Start with this ratio: 90% coconut oil, 10% castor oil mixed in your storage bottle.


Every night before bed, massage a quarter size amount into your skin. Next, take a clean wash cloth and wet it with hot water (don't scald yourself, however!), and gently wipe your face clean. Dry, and you're all done! 


*only wash your face a maximum of one time per day!* that's all your skin needs. In the morning, just splash your face with some cool water, nothing more.


After a few days, if your skin feels too dry, increase the coconut oil and decrease the amount of castor oil in your mixture. Likewise, if your skin feels too oily, increase castor oil and decrease coconut oil. Be very careful with the amount of castor oil you are using though, as it can severely dry out your skin.



**Results** 


For the first few days, washing with oil is going to feel very counterintuitive. After you wash and dry your face, your skin will still feel oily (obviously), but this is ok! The oil is acting as a moisturizer. After you wake up the next morning, your face should not feel oily any more.


I saw improvements in my skin after just the first day, and I haven't looked back since.


I hope this helps some of you out there struggling with acne!


Good luck!



**EDIT**

As has been pointed out, I forgot to mention that coconut oil is comedogenic, meaning that it may clog pores. I have had great success with coconut oil, but others may find it does not work for their skin.


There are several other base oils that you can use in place of coconut oil, however. Extra Virgin cold pressed olive oil, Jojoba oil, and Sweet Almond are among the highest recommended.


I do recommend starting with a lower castor oil ratio because too much castor oil can severely dry out your skin, whereas too much base oil can simply be wiped away. 


This is an all natural face cleansing process that has worked for me personally and countless others, but this isn't a miracle cure. If you try this process and your skin doesn't improve or gets worse, you should stop treatment and seek professional advice from a dermatologist."
714,LifeProTips,LPT: some tips on how to start conversations or keep them going,"I have a few tricks to get conversations going and keeping them from dying:

1. Shut up and listen. Sometimes people will start talking and something will come up that is a common interest. Even if someone just mentions for example the word car, there's nothing stopping you from talking about cars. Pick up on those and reciprocate. Takes some practice but you'll start to build in triggers in your mind and before you know it, you'll be leading the conversation.

2. Express an interesting thought from a movie, song, book, etc... Doesn't have to be on-topic, if the conversation is dying, anything goes! Last time I did that, I was talking about the movie Man of Steel and how the people of Krypton reproduced. Turned out the guy I was talking to teaches religion and obviously that was quite a conversation sparker.

3. If you frequently don't know what to say to people at, for example, a party: write down your own interests on a list beforehand. Store it on your phone or something. If the conversation dies, go through your list, pick an item and start talking about it. So what if it's a bit awkward that a conversation just started and you're already looking at your phone, they'll forget about that in 5 seconds as soon as the conversation is back up and running again. This one has saved me many times!

4. Little bit the same as 3, read up on current events before going to parties. If you really want to be prepared, augment your list from nr. 3 with recent news.

5. Don't start or continue conversations with negative thoughts. When someone tells you he/she likes film photography, don't complain that the colors of old photos suck. Instead, ask them what they find so interesting about it, for example ""What drew you to film photography?"". Remember: what the heart is filled with, the mouth is full of. A simple follow-up question can release a torrent of information which you can use in applying the other tips.

6. Share your experience on something you just did or are about to do. I told someone I was going to music school, turns out he does too and gave me a lot of helpful information.
7. Remember what people are or were talking about so you can always go back to that topic. Yes, that means paying attention!

8. Maybe as a reminder to myself, alcohol may be a social lubricant but it also makes you forget a lot of stuff! What are you going to do when that cute guy/girl comes over and asks if watch a lot of TV and you can't even remember what shows you watch? It happened to me and I'll be damned if I ever let something like that happen again.

715,LifeProTips,LPT: Improve Your Wi-Fi Signal Using a Soda Can,"If you’ve ever had a TV with an antenna or a radio, you’ve probably heard of the trick of using tin foil to improve the signal. Using a soda or beer can to improve your wi-fi signal works in a very similar way. The metal in the can and the shape of the can when cut open can focus the signal to and from your router. The only things that you’ll need to achieve this are a beer or soda can, a utility knife, a pair of scissors and some form of adhesive that can easily be removed like tape or adhesive putty.

6 Steps to Better Internet
1 – Clean Out the Can

Practically any substance that is found in cans like soda, beer, juice and more can create a sticky residue on the inside of the can. This can attract bugs and make your router sticky. Before you start cutting apart the can, thoroughly rinse it out with soap and warm water. Dry the can as thoroughly as possible.

2 – Pull off the Tab

The tab for the soda can really has no use for this project, so it’s best to remove it. To remove the tab, simply bend the tab back and forth until you hear it snap.

3 – Cut off the Bottom of the Can

Grab a utility knife and carefully cut a straight, horizontal line around bottom of the can at the point where the sides of the can start sloping to create the bottom. Cut very slowly to ensure a clean cut and to avoid accidentally cutting yourself. Once the bottom is completely removed, safely dispose of it to avoid accidentally grabbing it or stepping on it.

4 – Creating the Base

The base for your wifi extender will be the top of the can. To create the base, turn the can upside down and use your utility knife to make a cut horizontal cut that is similar to the one you made at the bottom of the can, but leaves an inch or so of metal to keep everything in one piece.

5 – Cut the Side of the Can

Position the can so that the leftover piece of metal used to keep the base attached is opposite the location you intend to make a vertical incision in the can. Use the scissors to cut a straight line from the bottom of the can to the top. Then open the can up to create a shape similar to a satellite dish. If the can is still wet at the point, thoroughly dry the can before placing it on top of your router.

6 – Attaching the Can to Your Router

Place the can over the antenna for your Wi-Fi connection through the hole in the base. Using tape or another easily removable adhesive such as adhesive putty, secure the can to your router. Adjust the can to maximize the signal.

Basically the can should be splayed out, creating something similar to a sail around the router’s antenna. The antenna serves as a mast and the pop can helps the router function.

You are now free to enjoy a stronger and more reliable wi-fi signal.

749,LifeProTips,5 methods I use to KILL my ego,"1, I use the ""I"" pronoun whenever possible instead of the ""you"" pronoun when giving advice or stating an opinion. AMAZING results. Instead of saying, ""You need to see this new movie"", I might say, ""I really enjoyed this new movie"". I do not have to even tell them, ""I suggest you see it"" because they can make up their own mind. ""You shouldn't eat so much fast food""as opposed to, ""I do not eat a lot of fast food because I know it's bad for me"" 

2, When someone gives me good advice, I do not let the person get in the way of their information. If someone tells me, ""You are LAZY"" I try to say, ""I will have to work harder"" rather than say, ""You live in your grandmother's basement and don't even own a car, and you're calling me lazy?"" 

3, When someone admits their faults, I acknowledge them instead of telling them how faulty they are. Odds are, the person who is being vulnerable about their weaknesses already knows their extent. I don't need to remind them. 

4, I ask others when I am confused. When someone says a word I don't understand, I ask them what the word means. 

5, Silence is my motto. The less time I spend showing others what I know, the more I learn. The best way I have found to show off my skills is to do it in the form of questions. If someone spells disc golf ""disk golf"", I ask, ""Are you sure it's spelled with a ""k""? This may sound like I am beating around the bush, but I am using this as a way to kill my ego. When they arrive at the right answer, they are the source of the right answer, not me."

762,LifeProTips,"LPT: Two secrets to shutting your brain off and going to sleep, from a chronic insomniac.","I have been a bit of an insomniac all my life. I can never sleep before I'm exhausted, and that's almost never before 2am (I thought it would change as I grew older, but in my mid-30s it hasn't yet).

The problem is that I just can't turn my brain off, I can't sleep. I can try to lay quietly in the dark for hours, but my brain keeps whirling, whirling, whirling away. I'll even try consciously not to think consciously. You can image how well that works. It's futile, so I have to get up and do something else.

However, I've discovered that these tricks just about always work to put me to sleep. The key is that you're not really trying to shut your brain down, you're engaging it, while the sneaky science elves fight a rear-guard action to put you to sleep.

**1. Read a book in bed with a Red LED Headlamp**

Only a book though, not Reddit or facebook, etc. Any paper-based book, a kindle or e-reader without a backlight will work, but never use a phone or computer, these shine bright bluish-white LED light in your face, no matter what colour is on the screen. **Blue Light is stimulating to the brain, and will keep you awake; avoid at all costs!** This won't work with a computer screen, a white (aka blue) LED head-lamp, or even an incandescent bulb (too much of the blue spectrum). 

Before I picked up a cheap-o $20 princeton-tec red headlamp, I would use a white one, and it just didn't work. I'd be up all night reading, especially if the book was captivating. Go for the red, read for a bit, you'll be shocked at how little you can read before the book hits you in the face. When you read with a Red head-lamp, your brain is snuggled down and sedated. It's better than nyquil.

--

**2. Audiobooks = Bedtime Story = Zzzzzzzzzzzzz**

The other trick that works every time at shutting my brain off is to listen to an audiobook or lecture series (like the amazing TTC ones that you can find at your local library, among other places). Music won't do it, it's stimulating, go for a spoken story/lecture.

I keep one of my earbuds in one ear and put my other ear on my pillow and before I get 10 minutes in, I'm in dream-land. Even the most interesting story or lecture series won't be enough to keep me awake, I'll find myself struggling unsuccessfully to stay awake so I can keep listening, but before long, I'm conked right out.

------

Those are my guaranteed go-tos for when I need to sleep. What are yours?

Edit: A lot of people seem to enjoy programs that darken or redden their computer screens. This can help, but the problem is that there is still a ton of blue light hitting your eyes, it's still a stimulant. Even a dark red screen on an LCD panel has a ton of blue light in its spectrum, and is still stimulating your brain."

I first dump the entire contents of the suitcase onto my bed. Now *at least* my suitcase is empty and I can put that away.

Second, in order to sleep that night I have to clear off the contents of my bed. And since it is all spread out (rather than trapped in the half-open suitcase) I can make faster progress at putting everything away."
768,LifeProTips,LPT: Tortillas are a good substitute for bread if you buy groceries for yourself. They don't expire as quickly and can just as nutritious.,"I stopped buying bread altogether in college because it would always expire before I could get around to using half the loaf. This combined with lessened purchases of milk, fruit, etc. I was constantly trying to find replacements. I eventually came up with the idea of sandwich tacos (not super creative I suppose) but I was able to keep all the ingredients refrigerated for a month or so at a time. They go well with anything that you would normally put on a sandwich and the only issue is that they tend to be about half the size of a normal sandwich if you do it taco style.

Bachelor Stromboli: Sandwich meat (I use ham or anything that looks good in the deli), provolone and tortillas. Throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds per stromboli and bam you have a pretty decent meal.


Edit: For the nit pickers. This tip was for the younger crowd, not for the health fanatics. It shouldn't matter too much anyways considering there are healthy tortillas as well as the junk food ones that were mentioned in comments. Also tortillas don't have to be refrigerated in order to keep their long shelf life; it is preferred though. In my opinion they also thaw better than bread.

Edit2: For all the people saying you can put bread in the fridge, most people in college don't have full size fridges. Dedicating half the fridge to a loaf of bread is pretty unreasonable."

773,LifeProTips,LPT: Easily save dying bees with sugar water.,"As you all know, honey bees are dying worldwide by the millions. As you also know, bees are a *very*, *very* important part of the ecosystem. I assume that most of you don't use bee-killing chemicals on your fields or have a garden, so I have a simple tip on how to save dying bees, one at a time, even for people living in cities.

If you spot a dying bee (or bumble bee), don't throw it outside or kill it. You can save that little fucker! It's easy and often takes only a couple of minutes. Step by step:

* don't be afraid of bees - just stay calm, they won't hurt or attack you
* bring it into a dry place (just put in on a table or whatever)
* take a cup and mix sugar (*not* artificial or diet sweetener or other crap, just normal or organic sugar) with water - something like a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio, small quantities
* take a spoon and make the sugar ''dissolve'', the end result should be thicker than water and a little bit less consistent than syrup (it's not *that* important)
* put a spoon of your sugar water on a dish and place the bee (use a paper to scoop it up) right next to it (*not* into it)
* observe the bee drink it and make sure that it doesn't end stuck in it (again, gently use a paper if it's stuck and try to help it out)
* open a window and turn off bright lights

And then wait. In my experience, even half dead bees will find enough force to drink/eat some. After usually anything between 1 and 5min, the bee will stop drinking, wait a moment and suddenly start flying again. If your window is open, odds are high that it will find it and directly fly out.

Younger I lived in the countryside and had to deal with plenty of bees. I never really thought about helping the dying ones, because they usually didn't die due to a lack of energy (flowers everywhere). Now, in the city, every other day I will find such a dying bee and I found out that this method works perfectly.

There's no point in killing animals, specially such useful ones like bees. Side effect, it's interesting to observe them drink and it's always a small victory when they fly away like nothing ever happened. Every bee I've helped with sugar water flew away in the following minutes.

Edit: Also, in case someone doubted, bees are not pets. As soon as they're healthy again, give them the opportunity to fly back home.

Edit2: Always use sugar if available. If you don't have any left, try honey. "

Then when drying off with your towel, take the corner of your towel, fold it in half and then use that tip the same way as you would use a q-tip. The difference being is that the towel is too thick to penetrate the ear to sensitive areas.

**tl;dr** blast ears with water from shower. Use corner of towel as a q-tip

**EDIT:** As you probably guessed from me using the world “blast” I am no doctor. This is just advice I have gained through life experience as with many of the tips found in this subreddit.

**END UPDATE**

Hey guys, I wanted to spread the word about a card my therapist gave me a couple sessions ago (I feel like I'm coming off as a salesperson, haha). 

I'm uninsured, and get generic prescriptions, but they still cost a good bit. My prescription at Target for Citalopram is **$26**. My therapist gave me a card she received from the Community Assistance Program. I took it to Target when I needed my refill, then put the card's info under my account without asking me ANYTHING about it, and that same prescription cost **$9**. 

The card saves you a different price, depending on where you go. They have estimated prices listed on their site, based on where you're getting it filled, what dosage you're getting, etc. I say estimate, because when I went to Target, the price from the website was off by about 50 cent or so. 

Anyway, you can either print out the cards yourself and use them that way, or you can order a bunch (&lt;50 cards = free shipping), and give them to your friends, family, homeless people, whoever you think needs help with their prescription. I'm about to put in an order myself for a bunch. 

If you're interested in seeing how much your prescription would cost with the card, check it out at this link- http://cashcard.lc.healthtrans.com/Pages/default.aspx

**WARNING-** This site takes a long time to load. I fear that if it recieves a lot of attention, the site might go down. Just in case it DOES go down, here's a link to the cards that can be printed, in PDF form-

~~[**PET** card](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zf19nhqe7cjg6li/CAP%20PET%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~

**IN FACT**, if you're just interested in getting a card for yourself, just use the two links above. I'd hate for the site to go offline for some little old lady out there who's already struggling with the internet. 

Oh, the other tip for saving money on your meds, it's just a minor tip, is to get larger tablets and split them in half. My therapist knows I'm short on cash, and I have this one med called Deplin that is goddamn $50 a month. Well, the price is the same for both the 7.5mg and the 15mg. I'm supposed to take the 7.5mg, so she prescribes me the 15mg, I cut them in half and I'm able to save $25 a month that way. 

Your doctor may not be so understanding. Some doctors are assholes! Some meds are controlled substances, so there's nothing they can do there, understandably. If you're interested, ask your doc about it, see what they think, and you might be able to save some money! 

**TL;DR** Print these cards out for ~~[**HUMAN**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/90pxpk67sod9wt0/CAP%20HUMAN%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~ and ~~[**PET**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zf19nhqe7cjg6li/CAP%20PET%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~ prescriptions. Save money. Ask your doc about getting a double dose tablet and splitting it in half- same cost for the pill, but you get twice the supply.

**EDIT-** User david-saint-hubbins linked Target's $4 [generic prescription program](http://www.target.com/pharmacy/generics-condition). I'm on 10mg Citalopram, 30ct a month, for $9 after the discount. By raising the dose to 20mg, and splitting the tablet, I'll be able to get a two month supply for $4! 

Also, I should add that this is **US ONLY!!!** Sorry Canadian friends, and other folks overseas. I think Mexicans too, sorry. 

Oh yeah, a few posters also recommended checking to see if the company behind the pill has a **customer assistance program**. I was able to get one of my prescriptions through an assistance program, and it has saved me a couple hundred dollars so far!

Before I get into it, let me first say that I am somewhat ashamed to share this, but it did work. I got my first car this way and saved quite a bit of money in the process. Note that this was before the internet was around, but I'd imagine it would still work today.

His tip was thus: ""Instead of looking though used car ads, go through the obituaries.""

His reasoning behind this is pretty simple. When the elderly pass on, they generally leave behind a car. The car generally isn't wanted by the surviving family members and they're looking to make a quick buck off of it and/or just looking to get rid of it during the estate sell off. Sometimes they're happy to practically give it away to a struggling college kid who needs a method of transportation. This is where you come in.

What you do is you go through the obituaries, look up contact information for the deceased and call a family member with ""Hi I'm calling about the used car your selling""

Most folks will tell you that you have the wrong number, but you'll eventually get someone who will have a lightbulb go off in they're head and will make a deal with you. It takes a bit of fishing, but it does work. 

Generally speaking, the cars you do get off of using this method are in very good condition and generally just need a brake job (the elderly tend to ride them a bit). I told this tip to a buddy in high school and he scored a free car off of it.

Also, use a little backstory on the call to get them thinking. For example ""Aww I have the wrong number? I'm so sorry! I've been calling ads all day so I can find a car that'll help me get to college and I must have hit the wrong button"". If you get a ""Oh...actually...."", you know you landed one.

You can also preload you subscriptions, but I have a lot of subs and therefore prefer to pick individual videos.

We were about to call AAA, but I gave it one last ditch effort with a helpful citizen walking by. They mentioned calling mall security. Never would have thought to try! They were there in a few minutes and jumped my car for free! Definitely useful information in case any of you are ever in this type of situation.

837,LifeProTips,"LPT: Shopping with kids - the ""one thing"" rule","When grocery shopping with kids, allow them to get one small item (with a price limit). Once they have selected their one item, every time they ask for anything else you can respond, ""OK, but you'll have to put back (first item). Is that what you really want?""

This way they get some control, which is what they really want, and you don't have to spend the entire shopping trip arguing and saying no.

This is part of a general child raising philosophy of allowing kids to make choices, but controlling the what those choices are. Another example: you want your kid to get dressed -- offer him a choice of the red shirt or the blue shirt. Result: you don't really care which shirt the kid wears as long as he gets dressed, and your kid feels like he's actually gotten to make a decision.

Edit: Just wanted to add, when shopping with some kids you may have to add some additional parameters beyond price. For example: ""Live plant from the floral section - OK. Live lobster from the the fish counter - not OK. No, you may not take him home and keep him in the bathtub."""

For one of my more expensive books I found that I could preview all of the pages I needed to read, saving me a boatload. 


They omit a few pages every now and then, especially towards the end of the books, but if you're in the situation like me where you need to read your book before it gets here this can help a ton. It's also free (though you might need to log in to see more of the pages), so if you want to live dangerously and try to get through the semester without buying a textbook, this is a way you could do it.

840,LifeProTips,LPT: the McDonald's drive through ,"I've worked at McDonald's for 9 months now, and I swear every day the people that come through are so stupid that they drop my IQ.

So I've created two categories: 

Helping you, 

And helping us. 

Firstly helping you: 

You can order a filet a la cart, and it won't come on a bun but it rings it up as only $1.

Free mayo packets, adding mayo on to a sammich directly costs .30.

If you order a happy meal, you can request a large soda at no extra charge.

You can request fresh hot fries,

You can ask for two apple packets, or one small fry in a happy meal instead of one apple packet and one baby fry.

If you ask for extra sauce at the second window we won't charge. 

This works at some McDonald's: if you say only *whatever you want that would normally cost extra money* it won't charge for it 
Ex: McDouble with only Mac sauce = 1.00 McDouble with added macsauce=1.30 

Our small fries are now 1.25 and our medium is 1.56.... Perhaps upgrade to the medium?

One pie costs $1 two cost 1.25.

One cookie costs .75 three cost $1.00.

There are such a thing as McDouble meals and mcchicken meals. If you order things as meals it saves you some money instead of ordering everything separately (the only exception is if you order a number 4 with no cheese just order two hamburgers a medium fry and your drink.) 

Do not i repeat do not eat the mcribs
http://i.imgur.com/H1cFg.jpg &lt;that's why 

If you come during rush hours our food will be fresher but if you come during non rush hours it will be faster on average dinner hours are from 4:40-7. 

Helping us:

I have no problem giving you a few moments to think, but please don't give me half your order, then ask us to wait I get yelled at for it because times matter. 

Don't order additional food at the second window (go ahead and order it at the first.)

Get your money out quickly I get yelled at for that too. 

I'm not telling you not to order ice cream or speciality drinks but, if you don't want to wait, dont they take a while to make.

On average drive through times are anywhere from 90-120 seconds (meaning from the time I take your order till the time you get your food it takes 90-120 seconds) they can vary but that's average. That means if you're running late, or close to late, don't expect to be able to just swing by quickly for a diet coke because its only one item because when the car in front of you orders 4 happy meals and 3 number ones with 5 ice cream cones you're going to wait 

Lastly: do not pick change up in the drive through I'm supposed to yell at you for that because when you take that change my drawer comes up short but its just too awkward not to mention you hold everyone up for 70some cents and this is immensely frustrating. 

Edit:because I forgot about the fillet and spacing :/

Edit: change that fell on the ground, not the change i am supposed to give you back."

869,LifeProTips,"Request: (US) An ""I-know-my-rights cheat sheet"" for avoiding illegal search/seizure","On my way to work one night in Louisiana a police officer flagged me down at a seat belt checkpoint even though I had my seat belt on. I was completely sober and not in possession of any illegal drugs or weapons. 

 I was not acting any more or less nervous than I imagine most people might be while being pulled over and then harassed for nothing. When the officer TOLD me he was going to search me and my car because of my ""strange and nervous behavior"" I told him I did not consent to the search. At this time his supervisor approached us and told me I should ""shut the fuck up"" unless I wanted to go to jail. The officer who pulled me over then searched my car and the pockets of my shorts.

Long story short, I was not charged with anything but I was handcuffed and driven to parish prison. After a lengthy conversation, consisting of me repeating that I knew nothing about illegal drugs, the officer told me he would delete the police report and video recorded from inside the car then dropped me back off in a parking lot near my job and let me go. 

After watching a video on YouTube titled ""Police officer gets owned by law student"" (where a gentleman who has had his legal gun illegally taken by a police officer then very matter-of-factly asserts his knowledge of his rights and the law to quite righteous avail) I thought that compiling an  ""I-know-my-rights cheat sheet,"" consisting of laws, precedents, and any other pertinent information to learn and/or reference if I find myself in a similar situation MIGHT help.

870,LifeProTips,LPT: Shop at Costco without a membership. ,"First off it requires you to know someone with a membership. Get them to purchase a gift card for you in a desired amount. The gift cards act as a membership for the holder of said GC. It will get you in the door and through the till. All you will need to provide is your name and phone number. The order is processed as a 99 member number and therefore does not require a membership number. 

Enjoy your shopping experience, and if you like it buy a membership. It's not expensive and completely worth it.

edit1: For those of you that think this is no longer possible, I assure you it is. You cannot purchase more gift cards with your current gift card. You also must use the entirety of the gift card before paying by any other means.

edit2: I completely agree with everyone saying Costco is one of the few good companies left. Next time you're in there take a look at the dates on the upper right corner of employees nametags. You might be blown away at how long some people have worked for them. Some of these people work simple cashier, packing, or merchandising jobs for over 20 years. Employees don't stay in a retail setting for that long without a legitimate reason.

886,LifeProTips,LPT: How to CORRECT your posture after your back has already hunched,"By Xiao

Here's an awesome and simple protip for you that I've learned from experience. Yesterday there was a request for tips to Improve your posture, which I was too late for. That thread did not have any solutions to correct an already hunched back, so enjoy this one:

You can correct a minor hunchback over time by lying on your stomach whenever you read a book or use a laptop!

1) Place a cushion under your stomach. This is optional, but it helps target the area of hunch.

2) Keep your neck straight and focus most of your spine's bending on where it is hunched.



*Q: ""My neck hurts from reading like this. Am I doing something wrong?""*

*A: Yes, you are bending back at the neck rather than trying to focus the bend where you are hunched.*

*Don't bend your lower back either, or you'll just look more like the letter ""S"" from the side, and no one wants to look like S. Again, focus most of your spine's bending on where it is hunched.*



It should correct your hunch over the course of several months depending on how often you work in this position. I've done this and now my posture is good. I've used an elastic back brace before I discovered this method; this method works much better. 

You do not need a chiropractor for minor hunchbacks.

2.  When you snooze on a regular basis, the very first thing you do everyday is procrastinate.  You put off the very first thing you do and you set the stage for the day.

925,LifeProTips,LPT: Keep alive tips from a desert dweller for those visiting the South-West.,"I've seen quite a few people hospitalized with heat related ailments in the past few weeks, so here are some common senses tips that I see people forget all the time. 

1.  STAY HYDRATED.  Even if you're not thirsty drink water, 1oz every few minutes if you're outside.  Just because it's ""dry heat"" it doesn't mean you can handle it.  Those visiting from humid areas always comment on how 115°F doesn't feel like 115°F hot. True, with about 0% humidity it actually feels like 105°F.  Well, the reason it doesn't feel hot is because your body is efficiently cooling you by evaporating your fluids very quickly.  Humidity affects evaporation and how hot you feel.  

2. PROTECT YOUR SKIN.  Not only by using sunscreen but by covering up.  Wear loose fitting clothing that minimizes skin exposure.  Tighter clothes and a large skin area will facilitate rapid fluid loss.  At 115°F with minimal skin protection you can expect to loose close to 1.5L of water per hour. 

3. BE AWARE IT TAKES A FEW WEEKS FOR YOUR BODY TO ADAPT TO HEAT.   Bodies of those of us who live in dry hot climates have acclimated to the increased evaporation rate and our sweat contains less mineral salts.  Therefore less electrolytes are lost when sweating.  Additionally, less fluid is lost as urine volume is decreased and the body becomes more efficient at cooling as your blood vessels dilate more. 

4. YOUR BODY HAS A LIMIT.   Above 110°F your body can no longer cool you down safely at anything above normal resting effort. Also prolonged heat exposure at this temperature starts to actually cause damage to tissues.  Things start to snowball quickly once your body reaches that limit, you're feeling a little nauseated one moment and next you're dying.  

5. THERE IS NO BREAK FROM THE HEAT. The heat never stops in the cities.  Concrete, buildings and asphalt all absorb heat during the day and radiate it at night, so the coolest you can expect it to be is a chilly 100°F for a brief moment at 5AM.  The temperature difference from Highs to midnight is less then 10°F on average. "

938,LifeProTips,LPT: Get Your Verizon FiOS ETF Fee Waived When Changing/Downgrading Service Bundle/Plan,"I'm a Verizon FiOS customer and recently decided to ""cut the cable"" and opt only for their FiOS internet plan, and I faced their ETF (Early Termination Fee) for downgrading my ""bundle"" from my original double play (internet and cable TV).  I recently bought a Roku 3 box and already have AppleTV so I don't need cable, and frankly I'm tired of paying their bloated prices for channels I never watch.

Their ETF -- whilst ridiculous given you're still staying with Verizon -- is applicable if you downgrade out of one of their bundles.

I'd done some research locally, and spoke to a CSR with another provider and by switching to their services, they would pay Verizon's ETF for me if I switched.  I'm pretty loyal and would rather just stick with Verizon (their customer service and tech support are just superior).  I'm sure in all other areas of the US, competing internet/cable providers would help with other companies' ETFs, too.  Ask around.

So if you're looking to cut the cord and go purely FiOS internet and want to get the ETF waived completely:

* Inform the CSR that you intend to downgrade to just their internet package and cancel TV.  They're likely to want to transfer you to their retention department, but tell them no.  Retention will spend their time trying to convince you to a) not go to the other provider, and/or b) sell you other less expensive services.

* The CSR will likely inform you that as you're canceling a bundle, you'll be hit with an ETF - tell them that you are aware of that, and you're calling to request it to be waived in full.  This will likely result in them arguing the fact that this cannot be done - **yes it can, read on, and stay firm**

* Tell the CSR that the other provider has offered to cover the cost of your ETF and that you're willing to switch providers if Verizon cannot waive the ETF.

At this point it's important to bring up some important numbers to the CSR:

* If they do not waive the ETF, you will be switching to the other provider and Verizon will a) lose a customer, and b) make only ~$200 from you (the cost of the ETF) - also mention that you don't care about the cost of the ETF as it's being covered by the other provider.  If Verizon can't use the cost of the ETF as an incentive for you to stay, they lose that pricing power completely.

* If they do waive the ETF, you will stay and they will continue to make a significant amount more over the next 24 months.  Without promotions, their 50/25 internet deal is $85, so over 2 years that's $2,040.

Trust me, they'll make the smart decision and want to keep you as a customer as they stand to lose quite a bit of money long term if you go to the other provider.

The CSR I spoke to didn't have the authority to waive the fee (none of them do), but advised that she would speak with an on-duty supervisor and explain my request.  A few minutes after being placed on hold I was given approval for a complete waiver of the ETF.

I did this today, *and* they currently have two promotions with their internet plan.  Over the next 24 months I am going to be saving more money.  For the first 12 months they're knocking $15 a month off my monthly charge, and the remaining 12 months $5 per month.

So not only am I going to save $17 a month by not having to pay for the HD DVR, but I'm going to save $180 over the first year and $60 the following - a total saving of $240 over the course of the contract.  And all without being shafted with their Early Termination Fee.

Total saving over the 24 months = $444 and no ETF. 

It is very important that you remain calm, professional, and treat all reps with respect when going through this process - or any other CSR experience for that matter.  Calm, happy, and professional = getting exactly what you want.

Customer wins.

p.s. Roku is really awesome.

p.p.s. yeah I realize I essentially wrote Fee Fee

He said, ""I'm sorry, we don't do that. You can only purchase the package."" and continued to try to sell it to me.

Loosing a loved one to cancer, sadly, is not a unique experience. If you ask me why I'm sad and I tell you I lost a loved one to cancer, I really don't need to hear how you too lost a loved one to cancer and how you still miss them.

965,LifeProTips,Life Pro Tip(s): A few dating suggestions for the Socially Awkward Penguins among us.,"* First and foremost, there's the more commonly known one. Don't do movie dates on a first date. What's the point? You spend most of your time watching the movie and less time getting to know each other. Most movie dates are followed up by a dinner, which is also not ideal, especially for the SAPs. 

* Don't do Dinner dates. Dinner dates are great for people who can carry a conversation and have no problems avoiding awkward silence. For the SAPs in the world, that's NOT GOOD.

So what can you do? The best options for a first date is to do something that is somewhat active. For the geeks among us, going to the arcade is a great idea. It lets you guys have fun while getting to know each other. You can also easily pass off awkward silence as concentrating on the game. Making witty remarks about the games you play should come naturally to most of us as well. 

Go to a pool hall. Pool + Alcohol + Girl = winner! Same as arcade really. You can get a little bit of alcohol in your system to loosen you up a bit. It doesn't matter how bad you suck at pool, you're there to have fun. It's easy to start conversations in between shots, and taking a little bit of time to gather your thoughts when it's your turn. 

In the end, what you choose to do should reflect a bit about you. Arcades and Pool for us geeks is great. You can stop by a toy shop on the way home and grab some foam swords to duel in the streets. Get creative. When you think about it, if someone was dating two people who were completely identical in all ways. You think they'd pick the one who took them on the average movie and dinner date? Nope! I most certainly wouldn't.

As a security guard I deal with a lot of theft, and I know many small things you can do in a store to prevent your own stuff from being stolen. One of the biggest is for ladies who take their purse into store. 

Purses get stolen all the time, but one easy to way really decrease the probability of yours being taken is to just put the safety belt in the child portion of the shopping kart through one of your purse handles and clip it, that way if a thief tries to grab and run they are tied to the cart.

981,LifeProTips,"LPT: Don't use the phrases ""you always"" and ""you never"" in a negative way.","For example ""You always leave the light on"" or ""You never unload the dishwasher"".

Statements like these are rarely true (there aren't many people who have never turned off a light!) and as a result they tend to get people on the defensive.

It's much better to say ""Could you please try not to leave the light on"" or ""I would appreciate it if you would unload the dishwasher more often"" or something to that effect. When phrased like this no one feels like they're being unfairly accused and your point is still made. They also can't refute your point on the grounds of it being untrue.

On the other hand they can be great if used in a positive way e.g. ""you always look amazing!"" or ""You never fail to cheer me up""

**Edit:** it's been pointed out that the counter example's I used may be considered passive aggressive (perhaps there's too much British charm in there - my bad).

987,LifeProTips,LPT: Get to know Benadryl better. It can save you tons of money and potentially your life.,"I know a popular and often revisited LPT is the concept that generic drugs are not any chemically different (in terms of active ingredients) than name brand drugs, but I'd like to expound on that a little bit, specifically on Benadryl. Most people don't realize how common it is for Benadryl to be combined to another drug or even sold by itself and re-branded with different suggested uses (allergy medicine and sleep aids).

First of all, learn the drug's actual name: 

- Diphenhydramine 

There are two common variations of diphenhydramine on the market:

- Diphenhydramine hydrochloride (abbreviated HCl) [9 out of 10 times, this is the ingredient you will find]
- Diphenhydramine citrate [this is rarer, but the tl;dr version of the difference is that it absorbs into the blood faster, thus dosage amounts are different than that of something with dyp HCl]

Now let's look at some brand names, their ingredients, suggested usages, and prices:

- Benadryl (Allergy medicine) (~$6.50 for 24 tablets) (one tablet contains 25 mg of diphendyramine HCl)

- Tylenol PM (Pain reliever/sleep aid) (~6.50 for 36 pills) (one pill contains Tylenol and 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Advil PM (Pain reliever/sleep aid) (~8.00 for 40 pills) (one pill contains Advil and 38 mg of diphenhydramine citrate)

- Advil PM Liqui-Gels (Pain reliever/sleep aid) (~9.00 for 32 capsules) (one pill contains Advil and 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- ZZZQuil (Sleep aid) (~7.00 for one bottle) (one teaspoon contains 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store allergy medicine (allergy medicine) (1.00 for 36 pills) (one pill contains 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store Tylenol PM (Pain relief/sleep aid) (1.00 for 24 pills) (one pill contains Tylenol and 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store sleep aid (sleep aid) (1.00 for 24 pills) (one pill contains 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store Advil PM (pain reliever/sleep aid) (1.00 for 24 pills) (one pills contains Advil and 38 mg of diphenhydramine citrate)

- It's also worth noting that when it comes to Children's allergy medicine (name brand or generic) the only difference is that the dosage is cut in half (one teaspoon contains 12.5 mg if diphenhydramine HCl instead of the usual 25)

There are plenty of other brand names out there that contain Benadryl, but this is just the gist of it. See where this is going? Stop wasting your money on ZZZquil and Benadryl and get the same exact thing at the Dolllar Store for 10% of the price. Dollar Stores do often run out of certain items a lot faster than regular stores do, so don't be scared to buy some Tylenol PM to cure your runny nose or some generic allergy medicine to get some good sleep.

You should also get in the habit of looking at the ingredients before you buy ANY medication (as well as stuff already in your house) and get to know them by their chemical names. There are lots of drugs with multiple uses and it's nice to know A. Exactly what you're getting and B. How to find exactly what you're looking for. 

Also, if you are ever around anybody having a major allergic reaction to something and don't have Benadryl around, you should know you have other potential options. Having that information could be a real difference maker.

Fast forward a few weeks and I was on a train going from Austria to Germany (Amsterdam) and I got up to go to the bar (in the same car). I had unwittingly left the camera on my seat (I was pretty drunk) and when I came back, some lady had picked it up.

5,books,/r/Books is now a default subreddit!,"This is an incredibly big step for this community, and the mods here are very honored to have /r/Books be added to the list of Reddit's foremost subreddits. With this big step, we will be looking to add more moderators and continue the fantastic community atmosphere this subreddit has developed. Big thanks to the Reddit admins, big thanks to the /r/Books community, and big thanks to the other moderators. 

**( Heads up: we will be making an official application post for new mods in a few days, we won't be looking for mods in this thread)**"
16,books,[Mod Post] We have decided to ban direct images and memes from this subreddit.,"We have had a long day discussing the future of this subreddit among ourselves and with the community, and we have come to a decision. Moving forward, we will not be allowing direct image posts or memes on this subreddit. This decision reflects our personal views as moderators and the views of many members of the community who expressed their opinions today and in the past.

Our vision for this subreddit is to be a hub for general discussion about books, and image posts make that a difficult standard to meet. It takes a very minimal amount of time for image posts to gain upvotes, since they are easy for users to consume and vote upon. This has made it difficult for discussion threads to make it to the front page for a long time, since images rise much more quickly. Banning them will hopefully promote more discussion based posts to make it to the front page.

Banning memes was an easy call to make. In a community based around books, it would be duplicitous behavior to on one hand promote provocative discussion, while on the other hand allow for low-brow, easy to digest image macros. This was also an easy decision to make because it was expressed vehemently by a lot of comments in today's thread, and in many threads in the past.

An important distinction that I wish to express is that we will still allow for image based posts, however they will have to be posted in self-posts. They will also have to include elaboration, and will be deleted if they do not promote discussion. 

Many users have asked us to make this sub self-post only, and we have discussed that as a good possibility. However, that would be analogous to treating this issue with a hammer. Our approach is treating it with a scalpel. Articles, reviews, interviews, and many other link posts are very supportive of discussion, and if you look at our front page on a regular basis, you will see that links like these make up a large amount of the upvoted content. 

We have seen a lot of people voice concern about the future of this subreddit. Let us prove them wrong."
21,books,Physical books should come with free digital download,"Just like many records and DVDs now come with free digital downloads, books should do the same.

Further, I'd be willing to pay MORE to get the physical book with the download, instead of just the download itself.

This post linked to 10+ ""Top 100"" book lists from sources such as TIME magazine, Entertainment Weekly, Modern Library, etc. They were all in such different formats, and such different ways of being presented that I wanted to amalgamate all of these into one master ""list"" in order to compare them (thirteen lists in total since I also added in the first 100 of the Reddit's 200 favorite books).

*Salt*- Mark Kurlansky

All her books are good, but the Alanna series, the Wild Magic series are EXCELLENT and the best ones of all are *Trickster's Choice* and *Trickster's Queen*. But you kind of have to read Allana first, or they won't be as good)

**Edit** I'm off to work after a glorious two days off so I'll be collecting a whole new harvest of books. I'll post more tonight. See you in a few hours folks.
"
63,books,"It took 2 years, but last night I finished reading the Harry Potter series aloud to my 8 and 10 year old children.","I started out reading a few pages each night but I soon realized that I would have to step up my game. A few became 10 and then 15 pages. We didn't get to read every night, but usually 5 out of 7. Boy those last few books are long! 
They had both seen the movies, but I made them promise not to tell me how it all ended. I actually got choked up when Mrs Weasly killed Belatrix. Now on to LOTR! Just kidding, I am done with series for a while. Any recommendations of books for a 10 year old girl and a 9 year old boy are welcomed."
86,books,Does anyone else rage when they replace book covers with pictures from their movie counterparts?,"Then experience a double rage when seeing the stamp... Now a major motion picture/or now a new HBO series? 

 I understand it's marketing reasons, but a book should stand on it's own as a good book. As books are often better than their adaptations... The quote that states the difference ""between books and movies is that in books the pictures are better"", really resonates with my feelings on this.

I mean if I haven't seen the movie version or series or heard of the book, I feel as though my imagination has been robbed, because no matter how hard I try I'll only ever see the characters as they look in on the damn cover.

Edit: Well I'm off, (for now) 3+hrs in the same discussion with you all has been mostly awesome, but time for work... Thanks to all here for sharing your opinions. :)

Edit 2: wow... a sneaking back to reddit and I find more comments to read through, again thank you all for including your own opinions.

I have no time to reply to them all, but I will add that again that I am happy that these covers get people to read. I really just wish we could find better ways. 

Also that I know that the covers in no way change the book, but there is something to be said about books that use an artists rendering to sell the book or the skills of a layout designer with the art in their typography. If you see no difference in seeing a cover that is beautifully illustrated by an artist and one just slapping cast photos on it, well that makes me quite sad. Yes it is all marketing, and packaging, but there is a difference.  

Lastly using the movie cover is just another advertisement for the movie, and we have enough of them everywhere else. Is it wrong to not want to be bombarded in yet another place? We turn on the tv we see mostly ads, so we go for a drive and see ads on the freeway, we turn on the radio and get more ads, so finally we go to get a new book and there again we find advertisements on the book covers.

138,books,"500,000 books need homes. Pictures and details inside.","Hello reddit, this post is about Carrie and her books. Carrie is the owner of Once Sold Tales, a book store 10 miles south of Seattle. Times have not been good to bookstores and Carrie is closing her store. She currently has about half a million books that she wants to find homes for. 

Because housing all these books is now costing more than she or her business can afford, Carrie is left with few options. If nothing is done, she will have to pulp all books left unsold. While there are many pounds of books, nobody wants that.

I know reddit is (rightly so) critical of help requests. Money is not the goal of this post, rather, Carrie wants to get people reading again. If you live in the Seattle area and want to visit her warehouse, here is where you can find it:

22442 72nd Ave S, Kent, WA (Google maps link - http://goo.gl/maps/NQUYk )

Here is her website: http://www.oncesoldtales.com/ where you can order something to get shipped out.

Here is a photo album: http://imgur.com/a/WnlQU

Carrie will be operating her website and selling books at the warehouse (1$ for paperbacks, 2$ for hardback, or 1.50$/lb) until the end of May. If she can afford to go a bit longer, she will. She is going to be offering reddit a special deal if there is interest. I'd be lying if I said the idea wasn't mine. Details are still getting worked out but it looks like 10 dollars for 8 books or 18 for 16. Details forthcoming as well as how to actually make the order. (price includes all taxes and shipping for continental US, so the plan goes atm)

(EDIT: Product being offered to reddit is a grab-bag, I don't believe titles can be chosen, most likely general categories. Please comment on what you would be looking for or what structure you think would work best)

(EDIT2: More details for the grab bag are being requested. Specifically kids books. Since they are way lighter and the bag pricing is dictated by shipping costs (there is really little overhead sadly) a kids books selection would have way more books. No clue on specific. Stay tuned)

(EDIT3 The reddit grab bag is  not live yet. Purchases from the site are full price and there is not yet the opportunity to buy things super discounted online. Please, be patient, I am working with Carrie to get the electronic side of things figured out. I promise I won't leave people hanging)

(EDIT4: I'm a moron. Thats pretty standard, but there is a Facebook page. www.facebook.com/OnceSoldTales )

(**EDIT5**: There are too many responses! Holy cow, and I thought I could reply to everyone :/. I need to get some rest, I have a job to get to in the morning, but I WILL be back and I WILL have more answers to more questions. This includes shipping internationally, options to donate money/books, and of course specifics for the reddit grab bag. Goodnight reddit, thanks for helping Carrie find a home for her books)

FULL DISCLOSURE: I used to read books all the time and when I found out about what Carrie is going through, I wanted to help. I'm not getting paid and I'm not an employee. If you think my photos are a little too good, thank you! I am a hobbyist photographer and appreciate the compliment. If you think they suck, let me know why (might as well get better at it). Carrie is hard to get a hold of, but I will do my best to help answer questions, update the post with as much info as I can, and pass along anything you would like me to.

142,books,"With all due respect r/books, I'd rather discuss the content of books, not how many you managed to score at a sale.","I've just finished reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. For anyone else who's read it, I am reminded now of the divide between ""classical"" minds, which appreciate underlying form, and ""romantic"" minds, which appreciate surface aesthetics. Both ways of thinking are legitimate, so possibly I'm wrong in posting this at all. But it seems intuitively the case to me that books are, pretty much by definition, about the underlying form of what's written in them, not so much the aesthetics. They could be printed on papyrus, electronic, free or ridiculously expensive, whatever, and it wouldn't be relevant to what is written in them."

Her class consists of mostly freshman boys, and I thought Ender's Game would be a good book to get them interested in reading. Unfortunately her kids are pretty low on the pecking order so it's very hard to get school funds directed her way and she can't get a classroom set of books.

If any of you have an old copy of Ender's Game (or any other books you can spare for that matter) laying around you can donate she would really appreciate it!  

Also, if you have any other suggestions of good books that might get this demographic interested in reading she'd love to hear them.

**TLDR: Wife teaches the ""Dangerous Minds"" class at her high school and can use any old books you have laying around - especially :Ender's Game"".**

EDIT: Her class is 20 kids (so I just need 20 copies)


EDIT: Thanks for all the upboats! I think we may have enough Ender's Games - but any extras she gets will be donated to the school library and any other random books you send will be much appreciated (and hopefully well read ;)

EDIT: Front page! Fact - Redditors are awesome.

EDIT: I'm positive my wife (and all the local libraries) just got enough Ender's Games - however if you still would like to help these kids out there are a lot of fabulous suggestions for different books by other Redditors in the comments:

The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie,
Monster by Walter Dean Myers,
The Giver by Lois Lowry

**A big Thank You to all who commented and upvoted.

156,books,Carl Sagan on books.,"&gt;A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts (still called 'leaves') imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles. One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person - perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic.

170,books,"[Mod Post] A popular post has been deleted, and for the sake of transparency, here are our reasons for doing so.","Recently [this](http://i.imgur.com/ffCvNAP.png) image was posted on this subreddit, and at the time of its deletion it had reached the top of our front page. Users in the comments, however, pointed out that the image was watermarked, and that the user who posted it had made other posts in the past referencing and/ or advertising for the very same company. 

As evidenced by the amount of upvotes and positive comments the post received, this post was seen favorably by the majority of subscribers that saw it. For that reason it was a difficult decision for the mods to delete it. 

This subreddit is regularly used as a medium for marketing, whether it be through spam, blogspam, bots, or direct sale links. You may not see very much of it, since most of it gets deleted by either the spam filter or by the mods, but if you are a regular reader of this subreddit, chances are you have seen some. The mod team defines spam as anything that aims to sell or promote a user's own work, and while the post in question was directly doing neither, it was watermarked and it was posted by a person with a vested interest in the image. 

Letting one promotional post slide sets a precedent for other promoters on this subreddit, therefore I believe that it was in the interest of the community that the mod team delete it. 

Promoting you own work is tough, and it is definitely great when users post original content. However, there is a thin line between sharing your work and advertising for it. When you are telling stories or posting examples of your work, that counts as sharing, and is a wonderful thing for a community such as this. But when you are watermarking images, and posting discount codes and sale links for your website, that becomes spam. 

edit: I do not wish to insult the original poster of the image or his work. I am sure that the post was not made out of ill intentions. It did not, however, match our set criteria for conduct in this subreddit."

180,books,Does finishing a book (series) ever cause you terrible sadness?,"I just finished reading the Hunger Games series and I can't stop sobbing.  It's happened to me with other books, LOTR, Harry Potter, and others, but this just kills me. 

**spoilers for the hunger games series below**

---

I don't know if that ending was supposed to be happy or something but it's left me a wreck.  So much left unsaid, Gale going to 2 without a word.  I don't understand what just happened.  Part of it is how sad the ending was to me and the other part is the sadness that the series is over.

I don't know why I feel such despair.  It's 2am and I feel like the sun will never rise again.  At least LOTR and HP had happy endings I guess.

edit:  Well it took like an hour and I'm thinking straight, but man that affected me.

""The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legends fade to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the third age by some, an Age yet to come, an age long pass, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings or endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning."""
188,books,My son just started Ender's Game...,"He saw the trailer for the movie and really wants to see it. I figured he should read the book first so I gave it to him this evening and he couldn't put it down.

Edit:
For everyone giving me a hard time for supporting a bigot (among other things) here is a quote frome Neil Gaiman:

""If I were only allowed to read or enjoy art or listen to music made by people whose opinions and beliefs were the same as mine, I think the world would be a pretty dismal sort of a place."" 

While I don't agree with the author, I can enjoy his work. You of course have the right to not support him. But please don't try to force your oppions on others.

So please instead of negative comments try posting about sharing your love of books with someone you love. That is what my post is about after all.

201,books,12 Books You Could Read That Might Change Your Mind,"So, people like to make lists; more importantly, they also like to criticize lists and fight over them. This is why lists are always the books one *should* read, or books that *you must read before you die* or the *Top 50 Books of All Time*. However, these lists are geared this way because it makes it easier to argue about a list, and to criticize it, not because it makes the list any more helpful. It's hard to argue with just a plain old helpful list. After all, there are many reasons (good or bad) to dispute whether Dickens deserves to be on the Top 50 All Time List (see my comment history), but it is nearly impossible to dispute a list that merely wants to be a list of *books I have read that I think you all might enjoy if this is your sort of thing*. This explains a lack of this kind of list: we can't fight over a list like this, and if we can't fight over something then why talk about it at all?

However, this might be the most needed kind of list. After all, if I am looking for a good book I don't need a list of the best authors of all time. I already know who Shakespeare is, and I have already rejected him as a candidate for my next reading adventure. What I need is a list of books that are *also good*, but not typically very well known. This means that a list like this cannot, as a matter of first principals, be a list of the best. 

So, this list will have the dual advantage of being helpful, and will generate a less argumentative response. So, without any more rambling on my part, I give you: **Sartorialconundrum's list of twelve books that might help you change the way you think about things**. 

The idea behind this list is that each of them take a different view than the established ideology in their field, or they take on a myth that we have come to take for granted in our way of thinking, or they are stories that don't quite follow a traditional character arc. The books cover politics, history, science, economics, literature, and journalism. 

* The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, by Thomas Khun.
* The Golden Bough, by Sir George James Frazier.
* The Assault, by Harry Mulisch
* The Skeptic, A Life of H.L. Mencken, by Terry Teachout.
* America's Great Depression, by Murray Rothbard.
* The Republic, by Plato.
* The God of Small Things, by Arundati Roy.
* Financial Reckoning Day, by Bill Bonner and Addison Wiggin.
* Selected Poems, by Ranier Maria Rilke.
* Lanark, by Alasdair Gray.
* Orlando, by Virginia Woolf. 
* The Dangling Man, by Saul Bellow. 

Everything is this list is a little off. Some you might never have heard of (Lanark), others are lesser-known works by well known authors (Orlando). Others are monumental works, but in a field you might not be acquainted with (how many people in here are well-versed in Anglo-American Analytic philosophy?). One is a lesser known poet from Bohemian Paris that most people don't read because his contemporaries out-shined him (Rilke). One is a recent bestselling novel that I chose because the author looks at her heritage differently than any other author I have read (Roy). One novel treats tragedy differently than most would (The Assault), while another deals with ambiguity in modern life (The Dangling Man). 

If you are looking for something different, I recommend any of the above. 

Regards, Sartorial Conundrum.

**Edit**: As one comment corrected me, I accidently wrote down the blog name instead of the book title. Financial Reckoning Day is a literary/historical approach to economics/investing, The Daily Reckoning is the blog that came of it. 

**PS** I am glad this got such a good response. I would like to see more of this collaboration. Arguing over what is in the canon is boring. Talking about books is not boring. 

Lastly, I promised an explanation for why I recommend all of these books, I.E., how they changed my mind. Right now it is late, I am tired, and I have a bottle of Dewars. I will leave the exegesis for tomorrow. 

Good Night! "
215,books,Brian Jacques and Red Wall,"I was really sad when I learned that Brian Jacques passed away a few years back. His books were the first full sized books I read as a child and I think it taught a lot of good life lessons. 

 Its' really a great series for younger kids to read and it really bums me out he won't be writing any more, he was a real upstanding fellow and visited children's hospitals to read his books. 

Anyways, just leaving this post here to see if there are any other redwall fans and to suggest this series to anyone with kids, lots of lessons and morals to be learned and you can jump in on any of the books without needing to know what happened before. 

EDIT: The thread hit frontpage, glad to see so many fans of Redwall on reddit!"

By time I had reached the end I felt so close to the characters, as if they were close friends or members of my family. It's sad to say goodbye to them, and it left me with an odd feeling of emptiness. The fact that it has a really heart-wrenching ending didn't help either.

275,books,Question: How many of you use the map in the front of fantasy novels as you're reading?,"My roommate and I had a conversation the other night where we learned that we use the maps in the front of books completely differently. I look at them before I start reading, to get a general idea of the shape things are going to take in my head, then I (vaguely) fill in the blanks as I'm reading, usually not thinking about the locations spatially at all. She constantly references the map while she's reading, to get an exact idea of where they are in relation to where they've been or referenced cities. To me, it interrupts the flow of the book to flip back and forth. To her, it's a necessary part of the story. 

What do you do?"
279,books,"Anyone else really dislike the ""now a major motion picture!"" versions of book covers?","For whatever reason it just cheapens the book for me. Now they are also doing it with video games that are based on books. Case in point the new cover for Dante's Inferno, http://imgur.com/qB1Pk.jpg

edit: let me just clarify real quick by saying that I totally agree with the point of that covers like these can help bring new readers to books that they may never had read. If a kid picks up Dante's Inferno because he really liked the game then I think that is great. I guess this is just a pet peeve of mine that I believe many others share. "

293,books,Often included with vinyl records is a download code for a free digital version of the album--anyone else think they should do this for books?,"The card typically thanks me for investing in tangible media and gives me a onetime download pass to get an mp3 version for portability. I love this, and think it puts us on the right path--the way I see it, this new era is going to be less about ownership over a specific object and more about purchasing a license to content. I'm not buying paper with words on it, I'm buying a book. It'd be nice if I could read it any way I feel like.
Unfortunately, the era of eBooks set a bad precedent: we pay nearly just as much to buy an ePub as we do physical books. I just paid $27 for a hardcover copy of Love and Shame and Love by Peter Orner; it'd be nice if I could read it on my Nook without paying another $12.

310,books,"Have you ever read a book that affected you so much, you had to stop reading for a while?","I am wondering if this 'phenomenon' happens to any other avid readers.  You read a book and the culmination leaves you so drained (in a good or bad way) that you don't have the mental energy to pick up another book for a few days at least.

**In a bad way** - The most recent example for me was *The Wise Man's Fear* by Patrick Rothfuss.  In my view, the plotline completely jumped the shark, introduces several *deus ex machinas* and completely changes the protagonist's character.  I feel the storyline has been completely ruined in a blatant ""ratings"" grab or desperate attempt to fix the storyline.  [This review](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/38361485) summed it up pretty well for me.  My apologies if this is a popular book and my opinion disagrees with yours.  The effect left upon me, though, had me drained and lexically listless - I will probably be able to read once more in a week or two, when the sourness wears off. 

**In a good way** - When I finished the Foundation series, I stopped reading for a few months.  I kept thinking about the Foundation universe and didn't want to read books for fear of the 'taste in my mouth' being spoiled.  I had also, just for a few days, lost the motivation to eat or drink.  I was also slightly morose that the author hadn't written any more books.  But then, even 20 books in the series wouldn't have been enough.  It was much after this time that I bothered to learn *about* the author, and explore more of things he had written.  (I was a fool and didn't know that Asimov was a famous person).

I am interested in hearing if a book has had any kind of an effect on you and in what way.

Edit: Great responses, I'm reading all of the replies!  I'm also going through and adding all of the books mentioned here to my to-read list.  Thanks for this.

Edit 2: Looks like *House of Leaves* and *1984* are the most popular choices.

Edit 3: And others.  Lots of great reading, thanks for sharing your thoughts.

Edit 4: 4 months on and I'm still getting replies.  How are you guys finding this thread?"
323,books,"""The fact that you like a book, or that it sells well, does not and will never make it a good book. There's nothing wrong with enjoying crap, but at least have the self-awareness to admit that it's crap you're enjoying.""","The above was a comment made a few days ago on a review that is nearly a year old.  The book was my own debut novel and to say the reviewer didn't like it is an understatement as she said,  ""Thanks to my broad experience and lack of discrimination, Theft of Swords isn't, quite, the absolute worst book I've ever read. But it loses the prize by a very, very slender margin.""

I never responded to the review (it's always a bad thing if an author does) nor did I ask any of my fans to do so (but nonetheless several who have liked the book did), and there was a kind of flame war that ensued.

I'm not upset with the reviewer (I've grown a thick skin and I realize that everyone has their right to their own opinion) but the review itself and this comment does bring up an interesting point.

After being profesionally published for nearly a year and selling more than 150,000 books I'm considering the series a success, because I can attach objective (not subject to opinion) criteria to it.  But to judge a book ""good"" or ""bad"" is, at least to my mind, a rather futile exercise.  There is no universal criteria that all readers, critics, and literature professors can agree upon to separate ""good"" from ""bad."" And I don't think the opinion of a reader bears more weight if they have extensively studied 'literature.""  But there seems to be an almost pavlovian response by some people that say if a book is popular, it must automatically be crap.

As an author I think trying to determine my book as ""good"" or ""bad"" is folly.  I'm more than satisfied with the fact that the vast majority who have actually read it were entertained and found it a good investment in both their time and money.

So I'm really hear to ask the people in /r/books - do you think books can be classified as ""good"" and ""bad"" or is it really just a matter of which books fit your reading prefernces and which do not?"
327,books,I refuse to buy any books with the movie version cover.,"Case in point, after reading that *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* post I realized I didn't have it in my library looked for it my local book store only to find the copy with the movie version cover.

Edit: That being said is there a [criterion](http://www.criterion.com/) type thing for books? 

Edit 2#: I went to my second hand book store and found a copy I liked for a good price also the [book depository](http://www.bookdepository.com/) had the same stuff for good prices. 

Also, obviously it doesn't change the content of the book, but for the price you end up paying for books I like to be able to marvel at the cover because it dedicated to the book. Also I like nice things.

Edit 3#: I should make it clear in my example, that this is certainly a book I've read before, I just didn't own it. I like collecting books that I love and I'm always happy to pay for an edition I find appealing. (Which has never been the movie version) Like a lot of readers, I tend to have a backlog of books that I'm intending to read so there is never any rush to get it into my hands. In any case, agree or disagree, it is all about opinion and it is a hard thing to argue but I've really enjoyed reading all the comments so far.

But there are a hundred other posts actually about books on this subreddit that are getting no attention maybe go give them a read too. This was just a quick post while I was browsing for books.

Edit 4#: I looked through my book collection and I have to admit I found only one book that had a movie cover: my second hand hardcover *Collected Works of Raymond Chandler* has on the dust cover an image of Humphery Bogart, but thats okay with me, he is a boss."
328,books,Looking for something to read? Here's a messy collection of book-recommendation threads on reddit. ,"Hi /r/books

I've been adding these threads to my list of saved links now and then, so it's far from a complete list. There are probably plenty and plenty of omitted book recommendation threads in other subreddits. I have - for instance - nothing from /r/programming, and not much else from any smaller subreddits. So if you know of a good book recommendation thread for, say, cooking-books or something else topic-specific but yet of potential interest to readers then feel free to share and I'll add it to the list.

Much of the recommendations in the posts below don't really differ that much from thread to thread, I guess. I'm willing to wager that all the ""life-changing"", ""mind-blowing"" and ""must-read"" threads probably list ""1984"" or ""Brave New World"".  But one might still fish out something new or old of interest.

Anyway. Confused? Lost? Looking for something to read? Well this here is nothing awesome or professional, but you might find it of some use:

361,books,Have you ever read a book that ended up revealing something disturbing about yourself?,"I'm reading The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath for the second time and I came upon a disturbing realization- I was relating a little too much to Esther. Too often her thoughts reflected my own. Just like Esther, I have my whole life ahead of me, full of potential- I should be excited. Instead, I can't help wondering, what is the point of it all? Esther's emotional struggle so closely relates to my own. And then I realized, she's crazy. Or at least having some sort of an emotional breakdown. And if I'm not careful, I could quite easily allow myself to follow in her footsteps. This was quite sobering. 

So, r/books, what have you read that hit a little too close to home?

EDIT: Two things. First, I love how books can have such profound impacts in our lives and serve as mirrors to our souls. Especially when it reflects things we've been trying to ignore. Second, I think 2udaylatif summed it up well: ""It is not surprising to find similarities in ourselves with characters in stories. That is what makes them so enthralling. Even characters who are reprehensible have humanity in them and that makes us realize how close we all are. The line between good and bad is thinner than we realize."""
409,books,What book do you think is most overrated by reddit users?,"I'd say it's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I thought this book was okay, but most redditors talk about it like it's the best and most hilarious thing they've ever read. I just don't see it. "
433,books,"When finished with a good book or series of books, I feel like me and the characters are breaking up.","I'm actually sad for at least a day afterward. Sounds so silly but I get an emotional attachment to them.

Along the same lines: I don't find that I feel this way if the ending isn't up to my expectations. If it ends too abruptly or is super dumb, I am able to release the whole thing easier."
445,books,People who say they've lent a book are lying to themselves,"You know darn well you'll never see that book again. You're just in denial.

It'll be okay. You'll find a new printing of the same book just as good. "
446,books,"I read the first 50 Shades of Grey (you know, for science) and I only have one thing to say.","If anyone out there is considering reading 50 Shades of Grey I’d like you to take a step back, look at your choices and read The Story of O instead.

448,books,Book exchange gift brought me to tears...,"Being an avid reader, I signed up for the r/books book swap on reddit gifts. I was grateful to have the chance to share some of my favorite literature as well as receive some new reading material. Today my package arrived and I ripped it open with all the excitement that one would expect a five year old to have on christmas morning. I LOVE books. Literally, if I could be paid to read, I would drop out of college right now. Lasagna_chef had sent me a message confirming shipment of my package and told me to pay special attention to the note inside. Honestly, I was so psyched to receive four kick ass books (World War Z, American Psycho, Everything is Illuminated, and House of Leaves) that I almost forgot about the note. I finally came down from my literature induced ecstasy and opened the envelope that was inside one of the books. Inside I expected a witty note that would make me laugh.. Instead I was BROUGHT TO TEARS. I am a college student and have posted about how I am struggling to make ends meet...just hoping for some advice on how I can be more frugal and cut corners... and this kind gentleman had done his homework and properly stalked me and saw this. Not only did I receive four fantastic books that I cannot wait to dive into, I received a generous cash gift to help me afford food and rent. I am amazed at the kindness that this stranger has shown to me. Tons of karma to you, lasagna_chef. I will repay you someday, somehow. "
450,books,The best moments in reading.,"Hector: ""The best moments in reading are when you come across something - a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things - that you'd thought special, particular to you. And here it is, set down by someone else, a person you've never met, maybe even someone long dead. And it is as if a hand has come out, and taken yours.""

From The History Boys"
452,books,My rules for reading. What are yours?,"These are my rules for reading. I don't always follow them, but I certainly do my best to try. I transcribed this from the first page of my reading journal:

1. Don't tell others how to read. Some people like to read 100 books a year, others like to read just a few--there's no wrong way to read. Your *Ulysses* may be another person's *Twilight*, and there's nothing wrong with that either. If someone was moved by reading *Twilight*, that's a good thing. There's nothing more elitist than looking down on others for not having the same taste as you.

2. Reading is just a medium; it's not better than other mediums. I read because I like using my imagination, and I feel reading does a better job of describing things. That does not mean that other mediums do not lend themselves to intellectual thought and analysis. After all, films and television have someone writing them, they've just chosen a different medium to deliver their thoughts.

3. Write in the margins. There's so much you don't get when you're not doing this. As well, it's wonderful to be able to see what you were thinking as you were reading a book. It's enlightening to see how your thoughts on a book changed since the last time you've read it. If people are like you, they'll enjoy reading your notes as much as you enjoy reading the notes of others.

4. Read books you love more than once. People who say that there are far too many books in the world to ever spend the time rereading a book don't seem to realize that they will die before they have read every book in the world anyway. You'll probably die before you read every book on your bookshelf. If you love a book, read it again in a few years to see if its meaning has changed. Also, reading a book more than once really allows you to get the subtleties that you didn't pick up on the first round.

5. Don't worry about what you're supposed to get from the novel, or how others interpret it. If you get something entirely different, that's perfectly fine. You bring your own life experience to the table when reading. Worrying about these things is just a distraction from your own experience with the book.

6. However, be interested in the perspectives of others. In every book you read there are things that you missed. Discussing books with other people can be really enlightening. They bring their own experiences to the table as well--experiences you probably haven't had. Many a ""wow"" moment has come from having someone point out a theme in a novel that you've entirely missed.

7. Partake in easy reading every now and then. Tom Robbins, Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Christopher Moore, Chuck Klosterman, David Sedaris, and so on. Reading Faulkner, DeLillo, Joyce, Wallace, Gaddis, and other literary works all the time can be depressing. Sometimes you just need a good laugh.

8. If something sucks, move on. You're reading for enjoyment, not to be able to say you've read it.

9. Pay attention to the author's use of language. Simile, metaphor, symbolism. Words are chosen for a reason.

10. Share with others the books you have enjoyed. Hopefully they will enjoy them as well. The community of readers is almost as important as the books themselves. Be a part of that community.

EDIT: For those who do not understand the title of this post, I am sharing with you what I go by in my own reading. I write this in *my* journal. I am also asking what *you* go by in your own reading/interpretation of a story. I am at no point saying that you should follow any of these rules, and I'm really amazed that anyone could interpret it that way. Do you really think I am telling you that you must write in the margins of a book? Seriously? If you think that, I think I'd rather you not write in the margins of a book. And damn, why's everything have to be an argument on Reddit? Christ it gets a bit old."

Thanks"
490,books,"Your favorite sentence in any book, ever?","Mine's from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (obviously):


**""The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.""**"
492,books,The saddest line in Ulysses,"I just had a revelation about Joyce's Ulysses, a book I love and have read multiple times. There are countless touching and sad moments throughout the book: Stephen's mother crying when he sings Yeats' ""Who Goes With Fergus,"" Bloom's despair at his infant son Rudy's death, Stephen deciding he can't help his sister because the family will ""drown"" him too, Bloom's father's suicide, Paddy Dignam's funeral and leaving behind his wife and son, etc.

However, it dawned on me that the saddest and most poignant line in the book might be the last line.  No, not the one you're thinking of. Not ""yes I said yes I will yes."" That's the last line of the narrative. The last line of the book are the only words that belong to Joyce himself. His signoff. 

""Trieste-Zurich-Paris, 1914-1921""

This doesn't get much attention obviously, but the more I think about it the more heartbreaking it is. Joyce creates his masterpiece as an ode to his home, ""dear, dirty Dublin."" In fact, all his works are in some way about his home.  The level of detail and amount of research he did to craft such a realistic portrayal of his native city is widely acknowledged to be painstaking. To call it a labor of love almost does disservice to both the words ""labor"" and ""love.""

Now think about it. Joyce chose to sign off with those words: ""Trieste-Zurich-Paris, 1914-1921."" He put them there for a reason. Nothing in Joyce is there by accident or happenstance. Why are they there? Because he wants us to know that the city he loved so much and took such care to render is no longer his home. He's an exile. Living in various spots in Europe. Hundreds of pages -- a masterfully crafted testimonial to his home ... and he's not there.  And he's not going back.  He'll never be home again.  He can only possess it in Ulysses pages.  The book you just finished?  That masterpiece?  That's Joyce's home.  It's all he had.  And you were just a guest in it.  "

**EDIT**: To all of those who have commented on this post, thank you.  To those that agree with me (quite a bit more than I expected), it seems we're probably in the minority.

A word about the tone.  Many of you attacking me haven't read the whole thread or have ignored the fact that I admitted the outburst above was childish and petulant.  It was.  But I thought it would have been disingenuous of me to change it.  It seems however that perhaps I should draw particular attention to this by editing the main post, rather than just saying it in the comments.

**I'm sorry about the tone of the post.**

I regret the use of invective.  I regret targeting particular posts (not explicitly, but they can be inferred) and I regret hurting anyone's feelings (if I actually did such a thing).

I am not sorry about raising the topic though.  It's a valid point.  I guess I was just irritable yesterday morning.  Such posts are rare for me.  

Finally, one parting thought.  To all of you who have criticised me, insulted me or attacked me over daring to criticise those expressing their opinions, or incredulously asking me why I was trying to ""police"" bookit, I refer you to a discussion of [irony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony)."

I don't know what to do, Reddit. I've used every argument I can think of and he refuses to see reason. He's going to make me sell them, I'm not sure when. If you live near Morris, IL and you're willing to take about 29 books at least for a few months until I can take them back and hide them or convince him to let me keep them. Many of these books mean a lot to me and I can't bare to see them sold off.
  
Update: There's been a great response so far. Here's the list for those asking: The Monster Hunter Hunter Trilogy by Larry Correia; The Walking Dead Compendium 1 by Robert Kirkman; Anansi Boys, American Gods, Stardust, Smoke and Mirrors, and Fragile Things by Neil Gaiman; Watchers and Prodigal Son by Dean Koontz; High Fidelity by Nick Hornby; Go Mutants by Larry Doyle; Reckless by Cornelia Funke; The Strain by Guillermo Del Toro; H.P.

I have bought and paid for the majority of these with my own money that I earned doing work.

The options I've seen so far are: give them to friends (This was what I was originally considering); A few people have offered to come take them (I'd say this along with the first are my best option. Also I'd get to make a new Reddit friend who's close by); try harder to convince (It won't work); Tell him if he wants to get rid of them he has to burn them, then draw as much media attention to this as possible (That might be a little extreme).

Update 2: I didn't expect it to get this big, thanks guys. My mom ended up finding this post when she checked my history last night. She was mad at first but I explained things better and we  talked for a while. She seems much more accepting and willing to accept than my dad does. Hopefully she'll help sway him. I think I've got them for a little longer now cause I don't think he knows what to do and my mom says she's willing to read some of them and see it from my point of view. 

Someone mentioned Fahrenheit 451, it's funny I literally picked it up the day after he took my books, knowing what it's about and I'm just waiting for him to ask, ""Oh whatcha readin there? What's that about?"" and I get to tell him haha. 

I got a lot of great advice and good arguments to use that I will bring up but for now things are looking up if only a little.

Salinger; The Complete Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller; I'm Dying Up Here by William Knoedelseder; Seriously Funny by Gerald Nachman; Comedy at the Edge by Richard Zoglin; A Great Silly Grin by Humphrey Carpenter; Hells Angels by Hunter S.

What can I do?,"I love books to the point where I'm so careful reading them they don't look like they've even been open, and Ive gotten into the habit of purchasing nice looking volumes just for the sake of the feel of it. Now don't get me wrong I own a kindle where I do my hard reading with hundreds of books but I even buy editions of books I have on the kindle just to have them on my bookshelf! Something about seeing them and knowing they contain all that wonderful knowledge and information through their pages, its riveting for me. I'm not the only one right?"

The person that bitches about how pics are taken over reddit, and leaving little room for anything else. I thought /r/books was immune. After all, if you're subscribed to a book reddit, then you obviously enjoy reading, right?

And I've kept /r/books in my subscription list for a long time now because it *was* one of the few reddits I could rely on to give me something to read or discuss. Only a month or so ago I realized that it was one of the few reddits with more than 50k subscribers that I still check on a regular basis. But for several weeks now I've noticed that image posts are consistently scoring more than links to articles and discussion threads. And, perhaps because they do comparatively better, it seems like there's more and more image-only posts every week.

I don't expect anyone to do anything about it, but I thought it was worth noting the trend."

672,books,What do you guys think of books as gifts?,"Since it is Black Friday, this question came up in my head. Personally, if someone really thought out which book to buy and give me, even if I had read it already or ended up disliking it, I would really appreciate it. They must have put some of their experience, knowledge, and time into the gift.

I know some people would hate it if I gave them a book, simply because they don't read as much, and I obviously would give different gifts if I knew there was a 0% chance of my book being read. On the other hand, I also know people who have been very thankful for a very personalized birthday gift(book with inscription) even if they might not read it for a few years rather than 20$ in a card.

And

""Not, of course, that there is any magic about the past. People were no cleverer then than they are now; they made as many mistakes as we. But not the same mistakes. They will not flatter us in the errors we are already committing; and their own errors, being now open and palpable, will not endanger us. Two heads are better than one, not because either is infallible, but because they are unlikely to go wrong in the same direction. To be sure, the books of the future would be just as good a corrective as the books of the past, but unfortunately we cannot get at them."""

     The world has changed, my friends. You know it, and I know it, but the present incumbent in The White doesn't seem to know it. His advisors don't seem to know it.

 It used to be that what happened in New York and Washington was important in Paramaribo, in Durban, in Kampuchea. Nothing was more important. Well, things have changed. Now we know that what happens in Santiago, in Tehran, in Mali is terribly important in New York and Washington. Nothing is more important

The Third World, as it's called, is no longer something out there - separate from us, inconsequential. Whether we like it or not, the world is becoming covered with a network of fine, sensitive nerves - an electronic nervous system not unlike that which integrates our own bodies. Our finger hurts, our toe hurts and we feel it as much as if our head aches or our heart aches. Instantly now do we feel the pain in Montevideo, in Judah, in Bandung. And yes, my friends in Winslow, we feel the pain from our own, internal Third World - from Harlem, from Watts, from our reservations of Native Americans.

There is no First World, Second World, Third World. The world is becoming integrated before our very eyes.

You and I know there is no theology, no ideology causing this new, sudden, total integration of the world. Christianity has had two thousand years to tie this world together... and it has not done so. Islam has had six hundred years to tie this world together... and it has not done so. American democracy has had two hundred years to tie this world together... and it has not done so. Communism had nearly one hundred years to tie this world together...and it did not do so.
 You and I know what is tying this world together, better than any band of missionaries, however large, ever have or could; better than any marching armies ever have or could.

 Today, satellites permit us to see every stalk of wheat as it grows in Russia, every grain of rice as it grows in China. We can see every soldier as he is trained in Lesotho or Karachi. We can fly to Riyadh or Luzon between one meal and another. Every economic fact regarding Algeria can be assimilated and interpreted within hours. It is possible to poll the entire nation of India regarding their deepest political and other convictions within seconds.
You and I, my friends, know that technology is tying this world together, is integrating this world in a way no theology, no ideology ever could. Technology is forming a nervous system beneath the skin of Mother Earth. And you and I know that to avoid the pain, the body politic had better start responding to this nervous system immediately! If we ignore that which hurts in any part of body earth, we shall suffer years more, generations more of the pain and misery of spreading disease. If we knowingly allow wounds to fester in any particular place, the strength, the energies of the whole world will be sapped!
     American politics must grow up to the new realities of life on this planet! Technology brings us closer than any Biblical brothers! Technology makes us more interdependent than any scheme of capital and labor! Technology is integrating the people of this earth where love and force have failed! This is the new reality! We must seize this understanding! Seize it for peace! For the health of planet earth! My friends, for the very continuation of life on earth!

-- For the past 11 years I've been the staff book critic at Time magazine. I review a lot of books, and I think a lot about what's going on with publishing, the contemporary novel, etc. I also get to interview a lot of interesting people—J.K. Rowling, Jonathan Franzen, Neil Gaiman, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc. [This](http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/23/genre-fiction-is-disruptive-technology/) would be an example of the sort of thing I tend to write.


-- I'm the author of [THE MAGICIANS](http://levgrossman.com/the-magicians-a-novel/) and [THE MAGICIAN KING,](http://levgrossman.com/the-magician-king/) which were both New York Times bestsellers. They're fantasy novels with a lot of literary and adult elements worked in. The marketing department calls them ""Harry Potter for Grown-Ups."" And who am I to argue with the marketing department.


-- I'm also the author of a couple of novels that were less successful and/or not at all successful


-- I've done a lot of freelance journalism, mostly about books and technology, for Wired, Salon, Lingua Franca, the Wall Street Journal, Entertainment Weekly, the Village Voice, Time Out NY and the New York Times. I also show up on NPR once in a while.


-- I'm an identical twin


-- I probably spend more time playing KINGDOM RUSH on my iPhone than any other New York Times bestselling author ever. I don't have the exact numbers on that, but I'm pretty confident about it.


-- I'm slightly hungover

694,books,This is why I love bookstores and the people that work there,"I walked into a lovely English-language bookstore today in the Parisian neighbourhood of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. I'm very new to Paris and my French is not great, so I still feel very anxious approaching people in stores, even English-language ones.

I spent some time exploring the store (which was awesome) and then asked at the front desk if they had Salman Rushdie's *Satanic Verses*.

The storekeeper looked at me very sternly and said, ""Mademoiselle, we do NOT carry subversive texts here.""

We stared at each other for a few seconds and then burst into laughter. He rang through my book and we had a nice chat about one of the store's most recent acquisitions, the complete notebooks of Antonio Gramsci.

757,books,"It's not often I read a 1,000 page book for the seventh time.  When I do, I decide to recommend it here.

It's kinda sci-fi, except the sci-fi parts are set in (at the time of publication) ""modern"" day.  It's funny as all hell, while also being incredibly informative.  

There are three main story-lines, with a few others that spring up later - one set in World War 2, following a math genius and Nazi code-breaking; another set in World War 2, the jarhead Marine whose duty is to make SNAFU's look normal (while kicking ass along the way); and the final a modern day character attempting to...well...I don't want to spoil things.

758,books,"""Self-published"" is not in any way analogous to ""published""","Unpopular opinion time.  Please leave your rotten fruit at the door before coming in.

I see a lot of posts by redditors and their friends about how excited they are about being ""self-published.""  I hate to say this, but being ""self-published"" doesn't mean ANYTHING.

Let's look at the word ""published"" first.  The mistake ""self-publishers"" make is equating ""hard copy of book"" (or ebook equivalent) with ""published.""  Thus, they think that if they print out and bind their work via iuniverse or something, they are then ""self-published.""

Nononno!  Being published is not just about having a hard copy of one's work - that misses the forest for the trees.  Being published is about convincing a third party that your work is worthwhile enough to support and make public.  It's about earning the respect of a group completely independent of you and having them fund the dissemination of your ideas.

For a novelist this means convincing a publishing company, big or small, that your story is worthwhile.  For an academic it means convincing other academics at a university press that your work is important.  For poets... well, you get the idea.  The bottom line is that real publishing means passing a critical threshhold: your work earning the respect of someone 100% unrelated to you.  There are standards you have to meet or exceed to move on.

When you go to iuniverse or Amazon and ""self-publish"" all you're doing is printing out a copy of your work.  There's no acceptance by unrelated peers - there's no meeting of minimum standards of your field, be it fiction, poetry, whatever - it's just a print shop.  Anyone with the money can print up their work.

This misunderstanding that ""self-publish"" = ""publish"" might not matter to the casual writers, who just want hard copies to hand out to friends, or to sell on their website.  But if you want to be a serious writer all this does is give you an inflated sense of accomplishment that will sabotage your real development.  Good writing takes practice, and if you skip the parts where you have to meet minimum standards, or earn the respect of your peers in an established publishing capacity, you're skipping the hard work.  You'll never, ever get better like that and you won't get any closer to a real, published result.

When someone sees a publishing company logo on a work, be it something huge like Knopf or something tiny like Quirk, people know you've been independently verified - that you've earned the respect of a group established in the literary field and that group believes in your work enough to make it public.  That's trust, that's independent verification.  When you have iuniverse on your work, all people see is that you paid money to print up a hard copy of your work.  That approval from the literary field at large (or your work's niche in it) is not there.

So, please stop saying that you're published when you just released something on Amazon, iuniverse, etc. - frankly it makes you look silly and all you're doing is avoiding the real hard work of publishing and sabotaging your own progress."
759,books,I have a question: is Dune by Frank Herbert worth it?,"Probably Final Edit: I want to thank you all for your incredible input. Really. You have said some great things not only about Dune, but about what defines genres of literature and how I should approach reading novels of different varieties. I've been looking for the wrong things in this book, and I shouldn't discount the quality of the book because of that. 

I'm going to finish reading it, and take your advice into account: I'm going to invest myself in this last bit and enjoy the book for what it is. It might not be my favorite book ever, but reading is not just about sitting back and zoning out into a book; sometimes, it's about pushing your comfort zone and forcing yourself to try new things. Heck, maybe I'll end up liking Dune sometime in the future if I reread it. Thanks, /r/books.

Sure, the setting is unique, the society set up there is reasonable for the situation, and the tale is told as an epic story of grand political schemes and personal character growth, but I'm just not finding the book to be fun to read.

To me, Paul is cool as a character, but I can't connect to him because of just how unusual he is, and after reading 3 books into the Song of Ice and Fire series, with its abundance of strong, complex females, his mother's character seems shallow and trite.

I guess what I'm wondering is: is finishing the book worth it? I'm already so invested in it, but the book hasn't made me care about the story or what happens to the characters. 

Thanks for your input, /r/books .

edit: also could any replies refrain from discussing the ending in detail? I'm one of those people who hates spoilers of any kind, so maybe keep the passage convincing me to finish the book spoiler-free?"

The update is here! Thanks for being so patient. First though, Carrie sent me a short biography about the store and herself. It is a giant wall of text, but the read is worth it. (I will make a nice cut off so you can come back to the grab bag details quicker): 

""Once Sold Tales was started by another man, Rick Henderson, in 2004. My then husband was out of work - an unemployed programmer/network engineer from the ""dot bomb"" - and he was moonlighting to help our economics out. Rick wanted another field of work, so he sold us the 12,000 books and business for 10% of the year's profits. In 2005, Eric Jenott wrote some software to manage the inventory and competitively reprice it, effectively making us competitive with the largest and most prestigious software companies and online book sellers. Within a month, sales had quintupled. We got employees and they worked in our basement to list books for sale and ship them. We started working with libraries and Friends of the Library groups early on, helping their organizations get money for the online sales of their books. We paid them 35% for their online sales, did free book pickups, and soon were working with public libraries, college libraries, Friends &amp; Foundations of libraries, Union Gospel Mission, thrift stores, churches, other booksellers, and were fundraising for all of them. There were up to 250 different organizations we supported throughout Washington state and Northern Oregon. We've gone from 12,000 books in our basement to over 1/2 Million books in 30,000 sq. ft. of warehouse. Those were good times. Books were flying out the door at good prices. I did some presentations at library functions to help Friends of the Library groups understand the online sales process. 

We have had a lot of fun. We threw a ""Tolkien &amp; Tea"" Bilbo Baggins birthday party and had a projector show all 3 extended versions of the Lord of the Rings on our warehouse wall while we served tea and ""elevensies"" to all who came, and many came in costume. The Knights of Veritas also came out and did demonstrations and we hosted their monthly ""historically authentic German Longsword"" swordsmanship classes in our warehouse (they are located in Moses Lake). We had a Steampunk English Contra Dance fundraiser and raised $500. We've hosted NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) participants who were writing novels in November and gave them tons of free coffee and cookies. We invited the local Etsy artisans in to show off their wares and get more public exposure through our bookstore, as we support local business. 

We also did a lot of cool things, too. We donated thousands of audio books to organizations for the blind. We did food drives and gave away free books to folks who would donate food to Northwest Harvest. We donated pregnancy &amp; childcare books to pregnancy centers, and thousands of books to school literacy nights. We also had a great ""Zero to 60"" Free Book program that let any child aged Birth - 12th grade to come to our bookstore and get 5 FREE books per month from anything in the bookstore. We've had about 1000 kids come in any given month and get their free books. I really think we did a lot of good and helped a lot of people. I try to remember that in the midst of seeing this ""good thing"" come to a close. A lot of people have certainly been distressed and sad to see us go and have told us how we've impacted their lives. We were a go-to for families with small children who got their free books each month. One mother had 2 dyslexic sons who had trouble reading. They started coming to Once Sold Tales to pick out books they were interested in and spent much more time reading. They had to build bookshelves in their home, and their dad reads to them every night and now they are proficient and avid readers. THAT makes it all worth it. We changed the world, one life at a time. 

Once Sold Tales was not only helping the community, but it also helped our staff, and my family. Before the business took off, we were fairly impoverished and going to the food bank. I can appreciate hard times and we never wanted there to be an economic barrier to children having access to books. Our staff have also been positively impacted by Once Sold Tales. At least 2 sets of couples have met at Once Sold Tales, and one has already married. Young staff who are often students have been able to pay for college and cars and have gained leadership and business experience from working at Once Sold Tales. Our turnover rate was ridiculously low - especially for the industry - as so many people loved working here. Recently, 2 people have bought homes. We help each other out. We celebrate birthdays and have a generous sick day policy - because life happens. I hope I can find another place to work that is half as awesome as it was to work at Once Sold Tales.... I'm going to miss the people so much and they have promised that we're going to have regular get togethers so we can keep enjoying each other's company. We're crazy, and we like it that way. :-) 

I've been working at Once Sold Tales for 9 years - since the beginning. I am a self taught marketer, supply logistics, HR, Bookstore manager, sales rep, customer service, software &amp; warehouse process developer, website designer, and partner organization liaison. I just generally call myself the ""Business Developer"" but now that we're an LLC, I'm officially the President and CEO. It is the most involved job I've ever had - before this, I was a homeschooling mom of 5. And through all this.....I was still a homeschooling mom of 5. :-) 

Asking me what is my favorite book is akin to asking me which is my favorite child... I enjoy an eclectic variety, but have noticed a distinct Anglophile trend - I love British authors and abhor post modernism. My favorite books: The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy 5-book trilogy by Douglas Adams, The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien, anything by Robert Louis Stevenson, C. S. Lewis, Yeats, Keats, Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Shakespeare... I like Tolstoy and Jules Verne and Richard Feynman. I'm completely addicted to Ted Dekker and devour everything he writes, even though it keeps me up all night because I can't put it down and it's frightened my overactive imagination. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" and ""Catch-22 by Joseph Heller"" (not so much his other books). I like Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe. The Three Musketeers. Adventure novels like what Jack London and Gary Paulson writes. Imaginative works that inspire like things by Madeline L'Engle. I'm hoping to read ""Master and Commander"" and other books by Patrick O'Brian next. I keep meaning to read ""The Wheel of Time"" series by Robert Jordan and have mutually enjoyed the works of Brian Jacques with my kids. I also think I want to read ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card. I like dramatized history and the occasional biography. I like some classics. But not, by any means all. 

We have a common rant at Once Sold Tales, and that is our frustration with miserable works being called ""classics"" about selfish, miserable people doing miserable, selfish things. I particularly dislike stories about dysfunctional families or women, chasing after dysfunctional men, and often it all coming to ruin. That would include almost all ""romance"" novels, Gone With The Wind, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, Wuthering Heights, Doctor Zhivago, and I know enough about F. Scott Fitzgerald and ""The Great Gatsby"" to imagine it is more misery. I have perhaps offended enough people with my disparaging remarks about Twilight....so perhaps it's best if I just don't go there. :-) My staff have a plan for our extra Twilight copies that I am now trying to GIVE AWAY for free. It. Involves. Kindling. 

At our busiest, ever, we sold about 3,000 books a day. Not too bad for our little company. ""

===

~~Product: Children's Reddit Grab Bag~~

~~Size: Small or Large~~

~~Contents: As many books as can fit~~

~~COST: 12$ or 20$~~

~~**IMPORTANT NOTE** Do **NOT** go to the website for a grab bag! The website is already bogged down enough, and you **CAN NOT** order the grab bag there. ~~

~~INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:  
	Is a pain. Even just across the border to Canada. Right now, rates are being determined so we can offer a standardized product. I will help get this figured out, but for now, sound off in the comments about what you think works best. Maybe a ""Here is X dollars, send me as many books as you can!"" deal. This will be updated and decisions will be made.~~

~~HOW TO PURCHASE:  
	Paypal is the way to pay. All payments to be made to REMOVED. Subject should be your products and the optional message is not optional. Make certain to share your category selections, but note: while Once Sold Tales will try their hardest to get you what you want, only Category 0 can be guaranteed.~~

Check the album in this post for an example: http://imgur.com/a/8wha3

~~HOW TO DONATE:~~
	~~I don't know! Paypal does have a Donate button, however there are issues involved, since Carrie is running a for-profit business. Implementation is simple with a Paypal Donate Button, but getting the money later has been difficult for others. If you have a suggestion, put it out there and I will find a best solution. Temporary solution: Buy a small random bag of books and beyond the 10$ price, include an itemized 'handling' fee of your choice. You still get books, but also contribute. Then, when the books arrive you donate them, since you are already awesome. If against Paypal TOS, then don't.~~

~~GIVING BOOKS:  
	Have a friend or library that could use books, but they are somewhere else? You can order books for others, as a gift,  just make sure to provide the appropriate information. Note: there are rules about sending books to prisons. So don't.~~

IN-PERSON DEAL:  (Warehouse hours: Mon - Sat 10am - 9pm, Sun Noon - 6)
	This one works on the honor system. If you can share Carrie's story with someone who hasn't heard it yet, feel free to show up at the warehouse and get one book for free. This deal is only for regular books (no Gutenberg Bibles, which she doesn't have) and only works if you are buying other books as well. (Listen, I could put all that fine print stuff, about one per person per day per solar eclipse blah blah blah, but just be a cool person. Its way easier, since Carrie will just say no if you aren't) When checking out, just say you are from the internet. No, really.

NOTES:  
	I have never done this before. If it looks like it was slammed together, well, it was. I appreciate the awesome feedback I've gotten and the kind words. If you commented or messaged me, I will get back to you. Give me some time though. Please, though, message me again if you don't hear from me in a week. If you fall through the cracks, I'm sorry and I will get to you.

**EDIT**: Carrie and crew are already seeing a ton of orders! I think reddit is going to break things, but rest assured that your orders will be worked on. There is only one person who is in charge of shipping so please be patient. I am at the store today, so stop on by and say hi. I will also be doing my best to share what I can and reply to comments, but be kind, I haven't been this in-demand ever.

**EDIT2**: I apologize for the weight limits being enacted. These are really high numbers (most bags are 1/2 to 3/4 that) but there are extra heavy books out there that are throwing off the numbers. These prices are somewhere between losing money and beating out pulping, so we all appreciate your patience and understanding.

~~**EDIT3**: International shipping is here! You select the categories, however there is only one size: USPS Large Flatrate Priority box. These boxes are 23-11/16"" x 11-3/4"" x 3"" or 12"" x 12"" x 5-1/2"" with a maximum weight of 20lbs. Carrie and crew will shove as many books as they can inside. Prices are $65 for Canadian and $85 for all other international. I know the price is high and I'm sorry those not in the continental US can't enjoy the cheapest of books. *Make sure to note INTERNATIONAL so the crew knows how to pull*~~

He also mentioned having an especially large section of architectural books and blueprints, which makes me happy because I'm an Architectural history major. When he heard that, he said I was free to drop by any time to come and look, and he seemed especially happy that someone would find the information useful.

Also, my library had books that are 80+ years old. I'm not sure if that's a regular library thing that I just haven't noticed before, but I thought it was pretty neat. 

The moral is this: drop by and explore your library, folks, because you never know what you'll find. :)"
783,books,"My grandma's book was censored for discussion at our local library because a single person felt that it was ""inappropriate for discussion"".","A few months ago I posted that my grandma had just published her first book, and that it was awesome for many reasons.  Here is the original post: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g1iue/my_85_year_old_grandma_just_published_her_first/

She has been in town all summer (she lives elsewhere the rest of the year) and our small local library has scheduled her to lead a book discussion and signing a few weeks ago.  Other local cafes have hosted her for this same exact event, as well as other libraries in other parts of our state. An anonymous community dweller here in town read the book beforehand and felt that it was ""inappropriate for discussion"" because the book used the word ""fuck"" and she objected to it. She called the head county librarian (about 2 hours away from our tiny local branch) and told her to cancel the scheduled book discussion. It was indeed cancelled, flyers had to be removed from town and people were turned away at the library door on the day of the discussion (who went there for that purpose). My grandma was shocked and outraged.  
In my grandma's words in an e-mail to me about it: 
"" Can you believe this? Not only censorship of a book, but censorship of ""freedom of speech"". NOT ONE LIBRARIAN READ THE BOOK and yet they believed this **#$%^ $!%^&amp; woman and cancelled the discussion based on her opinion.""  

She actually asked me if I would post her story to Reddit for her, so here you go. I think that any support, advice, or direction for her would be appreciated.  

Here is a link to the book on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/ROSIES-GRINGO-PALACE-Irene-Tritel/dp/0982805306/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315175779&amp;sr=8-1

I do have to go out in just a bit and will be gone for a while, but will be back tonight if you have questions you need answered. 

EDIT: I'm back, it's 9:24 Pacific time - here to respond to the comments who are questioning my validity....I guess? EDIT: It's too late, I gotta sleep. I also removed some offensive words above, as they were bothering me. Sorry. My perogative, nothing more. 



TL;DR: My grandma got fucked by the local library for using the word ""fuck"" in her book.

This subreddit has almost 180,000 subscribers. If you look at similarly sized subreddits, each has 5+. If the subreddit is going to continue to grow, and provide more of the great discussions it does, it needs more moderators.

876,books,What are your favorite book series that are longer- minimum 5 books in the series,"I know there have been threads about peoples' favorite series before, but this one is for longer ones.  I love nothing more than getting into a great series because who doesn't love a series that keeps you up until the early morning and then makes you get out of bed to find the next one and continue the story.

Here's my list:

* Robert Jordan's (RIP) Wheel of Time.  Really just an epic series coming in at 14 books.  The final novel is set to be released in January.  It got me over my fantasy prejudice.  The first book borrows heavily from Lord of the Rings and the author acknowledged this, but from there, it's pretty original world that he creates.  There's a minor issue in that book 10, Crossroads of Twilight, is pretty slow.  But the series is too good for a single mediocre book to drag it down.  I highly suggest it.  Give it a shot.  Mat Calhoun becomes the best character after being kinda a dick.

* A Song of Ice and Fire.  I don't think that this one really requires an explanation.  Another great fantasy world.  Martin really drags you in with Game of Thrones before putting in any of the weirder, more fantastical elements.

* Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series.  There are 11 original books that take Sharpe through the Spanish Peninsula all the way to Waterloo during the Napoleonic Wars as he fights under Wellington.  Sharpe is a commoner who was jumped up from the ranks and commands a groups of riflemen- skirmishers.  Sharpe is a badass character that is just a ton of fun to read.  Cornwell writes great stories and he does a fantastic job at describing the battles in a way that makes them come alive and also very easy to follow.  The series was popular enough to warrant Cornwell writing 3 prequels of him in India and now there are 24 total Sharpe books.  I recommend to everyone, but I think guys are more likely to like it.

* Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Stories.  Uthred is an Anglo (ok, I'm messing up the term) who is captured by Danes who raise him.  He loves the Danes and follows their beliefs.  But he becomes a warlord of Alfred the Great, who is responsible for creating the idea of England instead of separate kingdoms.  Uthred is another great character.  He's fun to listen to, talks down to the priests (except one or two), creates controversy, and is another badass motherfucker whose exploits are just a ton of fun to follow.

* Conn Iggulden's Conqueror series.  Follows Genghis Khan from childhood, his uniting of the Mongol people, and their conquests.  Later goes on to follow his descendants.  Really good historical fiction.  First book is a tad slow for a little bit, but it picks right up again.  Based heavily on The Secret History of the Mongols.  His Emperor series will be 5 books when the next one comes out, but it's just too fictionalized and untrue to the historical record for my taste.

* Colleen McCullough's Master of Rome Series.  Probably the best historical fiction out there in terms of scholarship, accuracy, and detail.  7 books take you from 110-27 BC.  Very long books that are pretty dense.  But the time period is well documented and she does a great job with it.  There are plenty of real characters that she uses that are all fascinating.

* Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series (AKA Master and Commander).  Probably the golden standard of historical fiction.  If you're interested in the British Navy during the time period, this is what you want to read.  Great books.  Must reads.  Hornblower gets a nod, but O'Brian's series is better.

* Simon Scarrow's Eagle series.  Follows a Roman centurion and his optio (think sergeant).  Cato is upjumped as a favor for his father and has to prove himself whereas Macro is a grizzled veteran.  They have enemies within the officer corps of the Roman elite who strive to undermine them.  Two really cool characters that interact well.  The first books start in Britain, but they go all over the Empire.  Pretty good to the historical record for the most part.

* Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series.  Kind of a guilty pleasure of mine.  Rapp is a CIA agent who does the whole counter-terrorism deal.  Lots of stereotypes.  He's a badass.  He hates the red tape and regulations that hold him back from achieving his goals.  All that good stuff.  But the stories are good, plots interesting, and it shits all over something like Dan Brown in terms of a light read that is actually good.

* King's The Dark Tower- 8 books, all really good.  Read it.

I know I'm forgetting a couple so I'll post some more later.  Would like to see what /r/books likes in terms of series and maybe find a new one for when I finish rereading Wheel of Time.

880,books,Fight Club: is it worth reading?,"I've seen the movie at least a dozen times. It's one of my favorites. I could probably quote whole scenes. Is it worth reading the book or is the movie so similar that there's nothing new to gain from it?

EDIT - Thanks peeps. It's on my post-midterm reading to-do. "
893,books,I have just been trolled hard by the internets.,"Ok, so with the final Harry Potter film coming up soon, I had my usual OCD urge to finish the book series before I watched the last two films.

I downloaded a torrent file with a bunch of books, and was pleased to see the Harry Potter series in it, thinking I'd finally get through it.

I trudged through, and finally finished it last night.

I was talking with my roommate and his girlfriend today about how I hated the end where they alluded to Dudley Dursley being the next Voldemort, and was met with looks of confusion.  I explained where it happened, and then we went back and forth, and apparently our versions of the book had been different.  I was confused, because as we got deeper into it, it became clear that we had read COMPLETELY DIFFERENT versions of this last book.

I checked the wikipedia, and it fell in line with what they were saying about the book, which I had not believed them because it sounded like it SUCKED compared to the version I had read.

I decided I must find out the truth, and went on a quest.

I then found the [FANFIC](http://www.melindaleo.com/fics/tsh/) I had just read, which had been placed in the massive torrent file, renamed as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  I highly encourage reading through it - the ENTIRE book was rewritten, and it was very well done.

I now go to find the real version to finish (pissed off, I thought I was done with this series!) - and I leave this post here for you all to be amused, ridiculing, curious, blasé, whatever, etc., et al, ad nauseam.

**EDIT:** Some of you seem to think I have an aversion to supporting the author, which is just completely untrue.  It happened to be in a big torrent of books, most of which were out-of-print/free.  I was lazy and read the books, so what?  I'll probably buy the series again anyways, just 'cause I like to own things, and digital copies just don't have the same feel.

For the rest of you who saw this as the amusing event that I saw it as, carry on."

Now he's working on a new, updated list with more data, so with that in mind I figure it's time for a new thread where we can add such data by voting on our favorite books with our upvotes.


Please be sure to:

- Include the author as well as the title in each post

- Only post one book per post

- Preferably include separate books in a series in separate post (IE, don't post ""The Lord of the Rings."" Instead, post separate entries with each respective book.

- Be sure to Ctrl+F to see if your book has already been posted.


I'll start with a few of my favorites.


EDIT: There are a lot of novels here which is wonderful, but I'd like to remind you that you can also submit books of nonfiction, plays, or short stories.

EDIT2: There are a few duplicates showing up. Please be sure to use Ctrl+F so that duplication can be avoided and Raerth can count more easily.

923,books,Anyone else getting fed up with soaring book prices? $26 for a 180-page Neil Gaiman novella is outrageous to me.,"I had to get the hardback of The Ocean at the End of the Lane for my local book club, and of course I got it for a substantial discount via Amazon, but I find it unacceptable that a publisher can list a cover price of $26 for what Gaiman admits in the afterword is a short story stretched into a novel, and which I think is really at best a novella (or, if Stephen King wrote it, an actual short story).

I think prices like this are helping contribute to the demise of the local independent bookseller, who can't possibly match the 47% discount Amazon offers, and to the demise of the printed book and brick-and-mortar bookstores in general. What causes this? Are paper costs really climbing that high? Are ebooks and the deep discounts they offer forcing publishers to compensate by raising prices on physical books? Or am I overreacting, and should just accept that having to pay $30+ to hold a book in your hands is the way of the world now?

2) Into the Forrest: A Novel by Jean Hegland 

Both are truly greats works of literature, in my opinion, and unique additions to the genre.

946,books,"The Fraudulence Paradox: Over the years, nothing I've read hits me dead center as much as this paragraph.","&gt;The fraudulence paradox was that the more time and effort you put into trying to appear impressive or attractive to other people, the less impressive or attractive you felt inside -- you were a fraud. And the more of a fraud you felt like, the harder you tried to convey an impressive or likable image of yourself so that other people wouldn't find out what a hollow, fraudulent person you really were. Logically, you would think that the moment a supposedly intelligent nineteen-year-old became aware of this paradox, he'd stop being a fraud and just settle for being himself (whatever that was) because he'd figured out that being a fraud was a vicious infinite regress that ultimately resulted in being frightened, lonely, alienated, etc. But here was the other, higher-order paradox, which didn't even have a form or name -- I didn't, I couldn't.

952,books,I'd like to recommend some books that I've really enjoyed.,"I don't really know how to do this, because my post was over the max characters, so I've decided to put the other parts in my comments rather than making three or four separate posts. Hopefully this works for you all.

I was looking at my bookcase tonight and I decided to pull some books from there that I really enjoyed, but don't often see people talk about, and share them with you. I always enjoy recommendations, and I hope you all enjoy them as well. I write notes for every book I've read. If you have any questions about the books, I can dig up my notes and share with you what I wrote while reading the book. I've shared what little I remember about each one.

1. [*The Counterfeiters*](http://www.amazon.com/Counterfeiters-Novel-Andre-Gide/dp/0394718429/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327049550&amp;sr=1-1) by Andre Gide - Set in Paris just prior to World War I, this novel uses the plot of counterfeit money to explore some pretty interesting concepts (e.g., what is value? what differentiates a copy from its original?). With a tone of hopeless nihilism, and a seedy, cynical prose, we follow human disorder, weakness and despair from birth to death.

2. [*The Demolished Man*](http://www.amazon.com/DEMOLISHED-MAN-Alfred-Bester/dp/B00446J08E/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327050274&amp;sr=1-1) by Alfred Bester - In a future ruled by enlightened telepaths who prevent crime by knowing about it before it occurs, how can one man possibly get away with murder? This masterpiece is a super interesting sci-fi read whose suspense will have you turning pages when you should be sleeping. It's not a highly intellectual read, but a lot of good fun to be had here.

3. [*Hunger*](http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Novel-Knut-Hamsun/dp/0374531102/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327051820&amp;sr=1-1) by Knut Hamsun - This is the story of a man who is losing his mind from starvation. It's a story of a man with too much pride. Honestly, very rarely does a book really get under my skin, but this book made me feel as though I was losing my mind. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but was glad when it was finally over as well.

4. [*Angels*](http://www.amazon.com/Angels-Novel-Denis-Johnson/dp/0060988827/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327051923&amp;sr=1-4) by Denis Johnson - After reading [*Seek*](http://www.amazon.com/Seek-Reports-Edges-America-Beyond/dp/0060930470/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327051923&amp;sr=1-6), I found myself a bit obsessed with Denis Johnson. I've now read many of his books, but one that has stuck with me has to be his first novel, *Angels*. Quite a few years ago I was having a discussion with a friend about the role each person has in their own life. I was on the side that people are often nothing more than captives of their own circumstances, while my friend took a much more Sartrean approach saying that each person wills their own life, thus is responsible for everything that comes out of it. This discussion is one of the major themes of this book. How much of a role do we have in our own lives, and how much of where we are is due to our circumstances? Denis Johnson is probably the best American writer alive -- sad he doesn't get more recognition.

5. [*Pigtopia*](http://www.amazon.com/Pigtopia-Kitty-Fitzgerald/dp/B002SB8OPM/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327058828&amp;sr=1-1) by Kitty Fitzgerald - I really enjoyed Katherine Dunn's [*Geek Love*](http://www.amazon.com/Geek-Love-Novel-Katherine-Dunn/dp/0375713344/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327052481&amp;sr=8-1), and when I set out to find something similar, I certainly wasn't thinking I'd find something better, but that's exactly what happened. In the same vein as Dunn's book, *Pigtopia* is certainly filled with gore and macabre. However, as shocking as this book may be, it is also filled with beauty. It's the story of a disfigured, abused, and abandoned idiot who has created his own world (a la Pan's Labyrinth) to escape his reality. Someone comes along and pulls him from his world to help him face the real world. This is an awesome story of rejection and love. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll stop here.

6. [*Second Hand Smoke*](http://www.amazon.com/Second-Hand-Smoke-Thane-Rosenbaum/dp/0312254180/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327058844&amp;sr=1-1) by Thane Rosenbaum - Honestly, I've read way too many books about the Holocaust -- I'm really done with this subject at this point. However, I picked up this book on my wife's recommendation, and I'm really glad I gave it a chance. Unlike many Holocaust books, this one doesn't actually deal with the concentration camps directly. Rather, this is a book set in Miami, following a card shark who lives by the wits she used to survive the Holocaust. More than that, this is the story of her family, and how her experience impacts those who did not experience it. Now maybe the title packs more of a hit?

7. [*Meditations in Green*](http://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Green-Stephen-Wright/dp/0375712933/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327058867&amp;sr=1-1) by Stephen Wright - This was one of the best war novels I've read. It's the story of the Vietnam war, and its aftermath, and the chronicle of the decay of one soldier. The protagonist is initially a cocky man, thinking the war may be a bit of fun, and something he can certainly get through unharmed. We watch as the man decays from an intelligent and strong person into a heroin addict trying to turn himself into a plant form. The amazing aspect of this book is how Wright is able to relate the Vietnam war to the absurdities in our lives in the real world. James Griffin (the protagonist) hasn't really left what is wrong with the world back in Vietnam. This isn't going to be very popular around here, but I enjoyed this book more than I enjoyed *Catch-22*, and Wright certainly deserves far more recognition than Heller received, but alas that's not how history unfolded.

8. [*Kitchen*](http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Banana-Yoshimoto/dp/0671880187/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327053858&amp;sr=1-1) by Banana Yoshimoto - This is actually two short stories, each dealing with death, transsexuality, kitchens and love. The biggest focus here is going on with one's own life after the loss of a loved one. I really enjoyed both stories, and thought they dealt with the subject matter beautifully.

9. [*In the Dutch Mountains*](http://www.amazon.com/Dutch-Mountains-Harvest-Translation/dp/015600402X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327054081&amp;sr=1-1) by Cees Nooteboom - I really enjoy the creativity of Cees Nooteboom. I've yet to read anything by him that I did not enjoy. This story starts in a classroom, where a Spanish bureaucrat tells a story. The story is of Kai and Lucia, the children of circus performers, who are forced to leave their safe home and travel to a place in ruins. Kai is abducted by the Snow Queen's sorcerer, leaving Lucia -- with the aid of a clown -- to save him. This is a great book for kids, but even adults will enjoy entering the imaginative and incredible worlds Cees Nooteboom builds.

10. [*Caucasia*](http://www.amazon.com/Caucasia-Novel-Danzy-Senna/dp/1573227161/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327054400&amp;sr=1-1) by Danzy Senna - Being biracial myself (Mexican/White), I am very interested in the subject of race. This is the story of a young girl's struggle to understand her roots and her identity. However, this book transcends the subject of race -- while examining it -- and is really a story of identity that any race can identify with."

971,books,"When reading a book, do you feel like the tone embeds itself in your mind for the book's duration?","I don't mean while you are actively reading, but the experience of being in the middle of a book and going about your day, the passive moments where you are within the story but not actively reading and moving it forward.

This is going to be tough to describe accurately, but I feel like the attitudes of characters begin to get channeled through me.  My general stance or posture towards the world always gets influenced too.  I think this is one of the reasons I love reading Haruki Murakami novels; the world takes on this magical tinge as I'm walking around the city after I'd been reading something by him like the night before.  Most recently I read Franzen's Freedom as I went through a break-up and I found solace (or at times, wallowed in the pain of the experience) through inhabiting the mental space of various characters through out it.  I am assuming this can't be that unusual, but it is rarely discussed as far as I know.  This feature of reading is one of the things that in my mind sets the printed word apart as a medium.  It engages your mind so fully that it almost re-calibrates your perspective for a while."

I get it: nerds like Douglas Adams, Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, J.R.R. Tolkien, Orson Scott Card, Kurt Vonnegut, Frank Herbert, George R. R. Martin, and J.K. Rowling. These are mostly good authors, and a couple are great. But we've all heard of all of them at this point. Why aren't there more posts about non-fiction books? Or literary fiction? How about discussion of classic literature, or reviews of new books that aren't necessarily sf/fantasy? Yes, I know these things get posted to some extent, but right now there are three different Gaiman related posts, a meme, an *Ender's Game* post, a post about *The* fucking *Alchemist*, and multiple posts about a potential movie of *The Giver*, a young adult book.

I guess this is just me blowing off steam and it will (deservedly) get downvoted to hell. It's just that when I found this subreddit I was excited, because I love to read lots of different kinds of books, and talk about them, and I thought I would find people who feel the same. So now that I've most likely alienated everyone here, do any of you feel the same as me? Do you wish more different types of books/authors were discussed?

&gt;This community is focused on discussing books, authors, genres, or everything else book related.

The current statement might cover it for us without any changes.  Discussion of books, info on authors, genres and everything else.  We may add scope to include the publishing industry and e-books into that scope as well.  

2)  **Rules - What /r/Books Encourages and Removes**  

These are my *draft* points of view that can be accepted, rejected or adjusted.  We mods are working through what should be carved in stone and what might need to evolve organically with the community...

* I will personally push for **no memes**.  None at all.  Point here is that memes become the antithesis of book *discussion*, which should be at the core of /r/Books.
* We will work to encourage posting of book-related news and questions that spur book-related discussions.  
* Book recommendations are a constant request.  Potential to have a process in place to highlight recommendation questions.
* Bookporn should probably be eliminated.  ""Look at what I own"" pictures rarely add value and there are subreddits like /r/bookshelf for bookish photo shoots.  
* Blogspamming is an issue today and will only become more of an issue. We will continue to ban spammers quickly.
* AMAs will continue to become part of the agenda.  The nature of /r/Books is that these will need to be more recognized authors plus industry people.

Point in all of this is to add an element of focus to /r/Books as the subreddit grows.  We all have seen subreddits degrade due to volume and lack of purpose.

We will also be putting out an official request for help from new mods - please keep an eye out.

As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they'd be asked the ""half empty or half full"" question. Instead, with a smile on her face, she inquired: ""How heavy is this glass of water?""
Answers called out ranged from 8 oz. to 20 oz.
She replied, ""The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes."" She continued, ""The stresses and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt. And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed – incapable of doing anything.""
It’s important to remember to let go of your stresses. As early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down. Don't carry them through the evening and into the night. Remember to put the glass down!"

296,GetMotivated,"Take a shower, fix your hair, get dressed. Everyday.","Pretty much title. I often don't have very many plans on Saturdays/Sundays and let chips fall where they may. When I get dressed as I would be doing like for work/school/whateveryouhave things just magically happen. I clean. I cook a nice meal. Things NEEDS to happen, and you'll find way. Open your blinds, see the sun. Remember that old friend who asked for a beer? Fuck it, just call him and meet up. You're already dressed, you'll be there in a minute. Need to take the trash out? Sure, you're dressed already and don't need to worry about someone looking at your ugly t-shirt and worn out pajamas pants. Go to store? Already dressed. 

Pajamas, too big t-shirts, going around in just underpants, is one of the worst motivation killers there is. At least for me. Hope this helped someone as I write this on a Sunday morning, fully dressed!"
303,GetMotivated,Today I almost got a ticket for my weight loss.,"A few hours ago I was coming home from work and I had a front headlight out.  So of course a cop pulls me over and walks up to my vehicle and does the whole can I see your license thing.  I give him my license and he looks at me and he says ""Sir, false identification is a penalty under law."" Before I could compute what he said he asks if i'm a citizen, and at that point I realized that he thought my license was fake.  I had to convince him that the picture in my ID was in fact me.  I told him how I had lost 40 pounds over the past year and a half and how much my body has changed.  I showed him my student ID and he held it up next to my license and he could finally tell the resemblance.  He couldn't believe that I had in essence become a different person.  We started talking about working out, sports, and college. A few minutes later he gave me written warning and encouraged me to keep up the good work.  I never really thought about how far I have come since I decided to transform my body.  Even though i'm not where I want to be, tonight just proved i'm sure as hell on the right track.  I've been a long time lurker on this subreddit and I would just like to say that GetMotivated has and is changing my life.  Let's keep it up!"

427,GetMotivated,5am-ers,"I had a thought last night that I might share with you, wolves. You see, about a month ago, I was swimming twice every day (700 yards, not much for a real swimmer, but for 5'11"", ~240lbs it wasn't nothing) and things were good: my confidence was higher than ever, I felt great physically, I found myself able to focus on things for greater lengths of time, and I went to sleep exhausted every night (which is a sensation that I value highly). I woke up every morning at five to swim, because that was when the pool opened, so I was basically guaranteed a lane, and then I swam again when I was done with classes in the afternoon.

Then I got sick; not seriously, it was a pretty standard cold, but it made me miserable and I couldn't bring myself to swim for a week. That led to the habit of simply not going swimming, morning or afternoon that lasted about three weeks.

Last night I was trying to convince myself to set my alarm clock to 5am and I had a thought: ""I'm not a very good swimmer, what's the point of waking up that early just so people can make fun of how bad I am?""

Then I had another thought: ""No one wakes up at 5am to watch someone fail."" People are either asleep or they aren't at 5am, and the ones who are awake are too focused on what they woke up at 5am for to think about someone else's failures.

I woke up at 5am this morning. I am going to wake up at 5am tomorrow."
482,GetMotivated,"When I was in 10th grade, I failed 4 of my classes. My history  teacher told me I should practice saying ""would you like fries with that"" b/c that would be my most probable career path. In 3 weeks, I'm graduating with a PHD from Harvard Medical. ","I'm thinking about going back to my old high school, and asking the teacher if she want fries with that. "
496,GetMotivated,A way I have recently changed my thinking that has helped me.,"I was listening to [this](http://soundcloud.com/resonance-fm/sets/24-hour-zizek/) lecture by psychoanalyst and philosopher Slavoj Zizek and something he talked about really hit me hard. 

The first example he gave was if you ask an adolescent boy about his father you will often get something about how stupid the father is in what a pretty typical adolescent rebelliousness. But when you observe that child around his father, you see a completely different story, one where the child shows some combination of respect, fear and love for his father. So which is the lie, the world in which that boy lives or the world in the boy's head?

Zizek uses many more examples, but one more that resonated with me was the idea of soldiers at war. A more vulgar example, a jew killing Nazi may have been torn apart by the acts he was committing and barely able to live with himself. But does that in any way change the monster he is? 

The idea here is that who we are is rooted in our actions. The story in our head, the world around us and everything else are abstractions of this most fundamental realm of existence. 

I can't tell you how many times I've found some excuse not to work out today, or not to study or not to give something my all and still retained the idea that I do give things my all, just not today. If I really wanted to I could though. 

The fact is, however, that the one time I don't work out - I sacrifice that part of myself that won't let anything get in my way. If I sleep until noon, it isn't a one time thing, or extenuating circumstances - I am now a person that will sleep until noon. 

I am not some person that lives in my head. I am what I do. And every time I fail to act, I become that failure to act - no matter what lie I want to tell myself in my head. 

Have you sat on reddit for a few hours today doing nothing? If yes, then you can make up any story you want in your head about how it is raining outside or you need a relaxing day, but the fact of the matter is that you are person who spent hours on reddit today, period. There is no story or context, just the fact of your actions - that is who you are.

Every since I've realized this I lost the crippling narrative of, ""All I have to do is x and then I will be okay"" - NO! If I do x I am x, if I don't do x then I am not x. That's it. It's not like I get to sit on the sideline and pretend I'm not living an actual life until I actually get something done - my actions are who I am. 

Since I have realized this, I no longer tell myself that I have to do x,y, and z tomorrow to be something. I am x, y, and z. If I want to be rich I don't have to get organized, or become organized - I must be organized. And that isn't something that I just choose to do one day as a chore, it's not some switch that I turn on when I really need it - it's something that I do or don't do through my actions, every day. And if one day I decide to be lazy or procrastinate, then that's part of who I am, I'm a person who is sometimes lazy and procrastinates. So I either act otherwise, or become that.

Sorry if this too steam of consciousness or doesn't make any sense - but it has helped me a lot over the past week and figured I ought to share. "
507,GetMotivated,I DID IT! I FUCKING DID IT!!,"About a month ago ago I decided I wanted to climb the hill that over looks my town. On my bike. There is a gravel road that leads all the way up it that hikers use to get to the top. It is just under 1000 ft  climb, and a brutal 1.8 mile climb to the top on foot, let alone bike. After my first try I made it a quarter of the way before backing out. Today I said was the day. And I made it. I made it all the way to the top! I feel so great about myself I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs when I reached the top and conqured the hill. The pain was grueling but I didnt give up, I stopped to eat a breakfast bar, take a swig of water and powered through.

You can do it if you put your mind to it. Power through it.

525,GetMotivated,"How I went from lazy student to a success. Tips, Tricks, and strategies inside. Willing to answer questions as well.","A little background about myself:

I used to be the one of the laziest kids around in High School. I didn't find High School particularly challenging, so I never needed to put forth the effort to study to get A's and B's. Head into college my lazy ways continued, and well as many of you know that doesn't usually have a good ending. Fortunately for me I told myself now is the time to change my life around. Fast Forward to now I am nearing graduation and will be graduating among the top of my class in Accounting. Not an engineering or mathematics degree, but still something I can hold my head high about. I give to you Reddit some tips to be successful and stay motivated.


1. Finding Motivation - It doesn't matter if you know all the correct ways and strategies to study if you do not have motivation. I don't care what your motivation is, but you need to find something that that gets you fired up. For me it was beating that smart-ass kid in class, people telling me that I was lazy, people telling me I was never going to be successful. Wherever you find you your motivation never forget and always reminding yourself of it. 


2. Proper Learning Habits - I give you an example of two kids that I know. One kid that I knew in college was always spending ungodly amount of hours studying. Hours upon hours of studying, yet he never did that well in class. He managed to squeak out with B's and C's. Another kid I knew studied hard, but never put in un godly number of hours studying and had a high gpa and always tested well.. The difference between the two kids, and they were similar when it came to smarts, is the way they went about learning. One kid sat there and just memorized and memorized and memorized. I would see him just staring at his notes reading over and over. The other kid I knew always had his book out, notes out, and was always writing things down. One kid was memorizing while the kid was learning. You need to be able to teach the material to someone else not just spit out random facts. 



4. Study Strategies -  Now that you know its about learning here are some strategies I have. What worked best for me when learning material was taking it slow and trying to nail down a topic before I moved onto another topic. You need to be active when study. I would rather spend and hour trying hard and studying then wasting five hours of my time memorizing. You need to test yourself write out questions and then answers. Go over your notes and be able to lecture them to somebody or the wall. For technical based classes you just need to practice problems there are thousands of problems you can find online for numerous classes. I want to add sometimes you can get a different perspective on things googling your topic and watching YouTube videos. 


5.  Time Management - You know time management is crucial, so use your time wisely. I went through periods in college and still do where I will have a ton of work and not so much. If you are constantly doing work to stay ahead you never quite feel so overwhelmed. One example is when a teacher tells you you have an exam coming up in a week. Why are you waiting until the last night night studying 6 hours when they had 7 days where they could put in an hour a day of studying and have more time for other stuff an less stress. Don't do it!

Edit*

6. Embrace the Suck - One thing I always hear from people when they are giving out advice is that you have to try and find enjoyment in what you are doing. I am sorry, but for myself I can't always find enjoyment in something like tax accounting or whatever it may be. Sometimes you just have to make embrace the fact that cracking open the books isn't going to be fun, but it will be worth the while in the end. Although it does help to try and study something that you are passionate about sometimes you have to bite the bullet and realize the cracking open the books will be beneficial in the end. 

7. Get a shitty Job - Now this one is more geared towards students rather than people who have graduated and gotten a degree, but some principles still apply. One of the things that really motivated me when I was starting to do poorly was my job. I had a job that was basic grunt work for a construction company. Not the worst job in the world, but something I did not want to find myself doing for the rest of my life. Having a shitty job like this gave me motivation to do well in school, so I could get a good paying job and do something that I enjoy. It also forced me to schedule my time better. I didn't always have a ton free times between work and school, so I didn't get distracted with other useless tasks. 

8. Self - Improvement - One of the best things here about /r/getmotivated is that sometimes we create a chain reaction when start picking up good habits. There are simple things you can do which will build your self-confidence, and help you in other aspects of life. There are many things that will help you feel more confident. I think one of the best things is exercise and you see visbible improvements. I never even stepped foot in a gym just did a lot of body-weight type exercises. You have no excuse if you want to get fit. Improving other areas in your life will help you GET MOTIVATED to do other things. 


tl;dr: Get pissed off and motivated, try to learn rather than memorize, schedule wisely, it's going to suck, get a shitty job, always improve yourself.

Loved to hear your questions guys thanks for the feedback, so far. Always remember the hardest part to changing yourself is the starting. 


I'll be back for more if you guys are interested just wanted to help some people out at reddit. Love to answer some questions if have some.

Wow, guys can't believe this has hit the front page truly remarkable. I have loved hearing all the success stories and those that are on the road to success.

534,GetMotivated,Read this a year ago. Turned me from beta to ALPHA.,"I don't know you, anon. I don't know a thing about you. I don't know where you come from, where you're going, or why you do what you do. I don't know if we'd get along if we met. But there is one thing that I do know: You are capable of much more than you have been led to believe.

As I am writing this, there are 6.7 billion people walking and breathing on our humble rock. The overwhelming, vast majority of them will pas through their 720,000 hours like a match struck in the wind. Hardly noticed, scarcely remembered.

Tomorrow, as you go about your day, take you time to look around. Are there a lot of people around? What do you see? You see mediocrity. You see average. You see everything about yourself that you hate, that you fear, but that you have been conditioned to believe is acceptable. Fine. Enough. A good job.

I'm here to tell you that you will NOT settle for what is fine. You will NOT settle for a good job. Fine is for the loser. Fine is for the guy who skipped the last set of his workout because he just didn't feel like it. Fine is for the guy who cheated on his diet (this goes for you too, you skinny fuck) because he just couldn't do it anymore. Fine is for the guy who took a nap instead of sprinting around town in a torrential downpour. Fine is for the guy who got the job, but not the one he wanted. That guy made second place. He has never embraced pain, personal sacrifice, or thrown himself into the fires of dedication. Most importantly, and starting today, this guy is NOT YOU.

You are not this person. You are destined for greatness. You have it inside of you, and you know it. You have always known it, you have felt it as a faint thumping in your gut. It is clawing, scratching, struggling to be set free. It needs your help. As long as you hold yourself to the standard of ""average,"" that is all you will ever be. In your dreams you aren't average, so why the FUCK are you settling for it now? What are you not doing right now, anon? What is eating at the back of your skull? Go do IT. You know what it is, soldier. The time to act is now. You will burn. You will suffer. Your demons will not be defeated easily. Every step of the way they will whisper in your ear that you aren't good enough. That you aren't meant to succeed. ""Just give up,"" they will mutter, ""you'll never be the best."" ""NO,"" you will reply. You will embrace suffering. You will finish that last repetition. You will claw through the agonizing pain, you will destroy the mediocre pussy in your head, you will break boundaries. You will rise above the rest. You will realize your potential.

You, anon, are no average man. now go do what you were destined to do. End of fucking story.

570,GetMotivated,"What I learned during 30 days of abstinence from substances (alcohol, marijuana, caffeine, ADD meds, aspirin/ibuprofen), sex, sexuality, shaving:","- If I am uncomfortable in the present, the best thing I can do for myself is to acknowledge why I'm uncomfortable and take steps to resolve it.

- Problems are always easier to face when you aren't running away.

- Virtually all self-destructive and potentially self-destructive behaviors are triggered by anxiety.

- Anxiety, when properly channeled is really fucking useful for getting stuff done.

- Putting something off until I feel like it is the WORST strategy for getting things done. Procrastinating ruins the present and makes the future more difficult.

- Avoiding uncomfortable feelings or thoughts is the most destructive kind of procrastination.

- Motivation is never found or given, it is only created.

- There is always a motive behind my actions. If I am wasting all day online, it is because I am more motivated to be comfortable than I am to grow. 

- I have to choose to want to grow and improve more than to be comfortable. It isn't ever going to happen by itself.

- Every day I push myself, I am amazed by how powerful and capable I am. 

- Every day I run on autopilot, I feel weaker. This is because I am letting the world gain power over me.

- Not everything goes my way. It never will.

- Life isn't perfect. It never will be.

- Anything, no matter how innocuous, can be turned into a drug if my motive is to escape my problems.

- Fantasizing about what I'd like to happen, or what I wish would happen is exactly as worthless as focusing on the past.

- Every day I choose who I am. If I don't make a conscious choice, then I let the world choose for me. 

- I'm pretty fucking badass when I choose to be.

- I'm pretty fucking worthless when I let substances or other people dictate who or what I am.

605,GetMotivated,A Quick Guide to Getting Started,"**Step 1:** Sit comfortably, take a deep breath, and ask yourself: “What’s more important for me right now, procrastinating or investing time in my future?”  “What do I really gain by procrastinating?” After you realize that procrastination is silly, tell yourself that you are going to study/work for five minutes. In most instances, five minutes is all that it takes to go from panic to productivity.

**Step 2:** Apply the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). This is a tool for time management – you study/work for 25 minutes and then take a short five minute break. This is called a *pomodoro*. After four pomodoros, you take a longer break of 20 minutes. I recommend using [Focus Booster](http://www.focusboosterapp.com/) and setting it to play the ticking sound. How is this useful? It helps you resist interruptions and focus on finishing.

**Step 3:** Adjust your internal dialogue. Read *The Now Habit* by Neil Fiore if you haven’t. By reading this book you will understand that distress comes from the anxiety of delaying projects (among others). Procrastination is a result of things like pressure and fear – the only way to defeat it is by reducing negative emotions. TheCourageWolf wrote a great post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/rxsbz/introduction_to_motivation/) on emotions.

Because your internal dialogue determines how you feel and act, it’s important to change the way you talk to yourself.  I highly recommend replacing the following self-statements:

* Replace “I have to” with “I choose to.”

* Replace “I must finish” with “When can I start?”

* Replace “This is so big” with “I can begin by taking one small step.”

* Replace “I must be perfect” with “I can be human” and accept it.

* Replace “I don’t have time” with “I must take time.”

**Step 4:** Reward yourself after you have earned it and rest.

638,GetMotivated,"DAE feel like being labeled a ""smart kid"" set them up for a lot of disappointment and/or failure in life? [Old, but great comment from 1 year+ ago by a redditor]","[Stumbled upon this old comment, thought I'll re-post this for the guys out there who feel like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/e4ejp/dae_feel_like_being_labeled_a_smart_kid_set_them/c158f4b)

Let's examine the reasons behind this result, from a purely theoretical point of view.

When people are given a good label, they make an effort to keep it.

If you're called smart, how do you keep the label? By not trying.

If you try your very best, and fail, then it means you weren't smart enough, or maybe that you're not smart anymore at all. So, you try only a little bit, so you can blame your failure on the attribute that no one seems to care about: lack of motivation. The smarter you are, the less you try, because a supergenius should be able to succeed with almost no effort, right?

Plus, the smartness is really outside of your control. You can't do much to increase your intelligence. Feeling better than others about it would be like feeling better than others because you were born with good looks. So even if eveyone else gives you credit for being smart, if feels weird to give yourself any credit for it. Ironically, it's precisely because you're smart that you come to this realization early on.

Now, what if they didn't praise you for smartness, but praised you for working hard, trying hard, being a go-getter, doing your best always, being motivated, etc.?

Work ethic is something you can control. Your self esteem is no longer tied to some fixed attribute, but to an attribute you can maintain through will. It gives you power over your label.

The only way to keep the label in this case is to actually try your best at things. In fact, it doesn't really matter if you fail, now. If you tried your best, you can still feel proud of yourself no matter what the outcome is. The outcome mattered in the smartness case, but here the process matters.

Lastly, it's an attribute you can genuinely give yourself credit for, because you're the one willing yourself to try your best, so it's not something that you just happened to have at birth.

If you had been praised for being motivated, early 20s (most of reddit) is when you become the most powerful. You're a young adult, and you can finally get things done, and have an influence on the world. Moreover, early 20s is all about taking your life under your control. Those who were praised for being go-getters now shine bright.

But what if you were praised for being smart? When you're in your early 20s, you've lost the amazing superlearning child brain that you used to have. You introspect on your mind, and feel dull. You begin to worry that your time is over, that you can no longer match the learning ability of your younger days, and that your worth has gone down. Now, more than ever, you shy away from trying very hard, to deny this reality and maintain the label.

Is it all the fault of the praisers? No, of course not. They didn't live your life for you. However, they helped define your backwards value system that set you up for poor assessments of yourself. But, you're old enough to redefine those values, and there's no better time than now. After all, in the end, hard work and motivation is a far more praiseworthy thing than smartness. So stop caring if you fail and (this is the hard part) stop caring whether you remain smart in the eyes of others. In their minds, your main attribute should be that you are motivated and always trying and always going above and beyond what effort is asked of you.

650,GetMotivated,Get all your shit done on Sunday to make the coming week your bitch,"Over the years Sunday has become my day of productivity. During the week, things fall by the wayside and the house gets dirty, laundry piles up, etc. But Sunday is the first day of the week and there is no reason not to attack it with everything you've got.

I do all my laundry, and while that is going on I do my homework for the entire week. I buy and MAKE food for the entire week (something I can just reheat on the go). I clean my entire house from top to bottom. I look at every appointment for the coming week and find out what I need to do so that I can already be prepared the day of and I do it (fill out forms, get documents together, etc.). I also like to go outside, have a beer, watch the sunset and just think about the days ahead and what kind of shit I have to get done because I know I won't have many free seconds once shit starts up.

There is a zen-like feeling on Sunday night knowing that I already conquered the week ahead. My food is made, my work is done, and my house is clean. Anything I do with my free time during the week is icing on the cake.

Seriously. Try it. 8 hours of productivity for a week of feeling like a boss."
696,GetMotivated,"By studying 30mins a day for 600days, I mastered the Japanese writing system","I started using Anki(a SRS software) 606 days ago. Since then I managed to create a deck of  over 9300 cards and reviewed them over 80.000 times. I spent over 330 hours studying my deck (ca. 30min a day). My deck now contains about 93% of the commonly used Kanji of the Japanese language.

When I started studying the Japanese writing system, I was overwhelmed by the idea, that I'd have to learn over 2000 different characters to be able to read a newspaper. 
And while the last 600 days were not always easy (I worked most of the time for over 12hours a day) I managed to come much closer to realizing my dream. 

If you believe in yourself and devote a little bit of time everyday, it will surely pay off. 

Now I will go and tackle the last 7%!!"
730,GetMotivated,It's been a year. And I'm extremely proud of it.,"Been lurking this sub and others for over a year now. But I wanted to share my story with you guys.

A year ago today is when I finally started the uphill battle of my life. I was finishing up my 3rd year of college studying something I hated, and not succeeding at it either. I was maybe a few months out of a very unhealthy relationship after finding out she cheated on me with a good friend of mine. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get a job. In November of 2011, while away at school, I found out my dad was diagnosed with leukemia. My childhood dog (and best friend) had suddenly died and I was so lost. All of this caused my confidence to be at an all time low. I saw no reason to succeed at anything. I didn't go to class because I couldn't leave the house. I saw myself as an ugly fat socially awkward kid who had no job and was failing at school. I became lazy and borderline depressed. There was something wrong. My life was on a steady decline.

On May 6, 2012 I gave myself a firm kick in the pants. This was not the path I imagined as a successful high school student. A kid that played on 4 sport teams at a time. I had to take a step back and really think about what I was doing to my future. I set 3 goals for myself: 1. Get a job. 2. Succeed in school. 3. Get back to playing hockey. So, instead of spending the summer at school to get away from my family, I came home for good. That was the most difficult summer of my life, but it had to be done. It had to happen if I ever wanted to turn it around. I enrolled at the local community college for the fall semester. I went out every day looking for a job. And I began to exercise again. I expected to see quick results, and when they didn't come, it was hard to keep going. But I pushed myself. Focusing on the end goal; the ""pinnacle me"". As the summer progressed I saw a gradual change in my physical self and a small change in how I felt. In late August, I got a job doing what I was passionate about. The one place I wanted to work at all along finally worked out. This was huge. My confidence and mood were the best they've been since my freshman year. 

I still have that job. My GPA has never been better. And I'm playing more and more hockey. Goals 1, 2 and 3; done. 18 months after being at the lowest point in my life I'm at the highest point in my life. 

So, after 1 year of hard work, I'm here to say that I'm well on my way to becoming the best I can be. And every single one of you can be too. It all starts with yourself. Be who you WANT to be. Get out there and do it! "
739,GetMotivated,The Reddit Filter Bubble: How I Used Reddit To Change My Life,"A few months ago, I realized that we really do live in a filter bubble - not only in Google, Facebook etc but also on Reddit! Fortunately, on Reddit we can change our bubble! I removed all ""damaging"" or negative subreddits from my subscriptions and replaced them with positive ones. I now have all these inspiring people talking about making something of themselves and actually doing something useful and it was an incredible motivation. Since then, I stopped drinking alcohol, I started doing sports each day, I started reading for 40 minutes in a real book (not just online articles) each day. I started taking concrete steps towards my real dream (having my own business -&gt; started developing Android apps and a blog about my progress), started clearing my inbox each day (previously I never did this resulting in 10000+ mails). Here's some of the subreddits I subscribed to and some posts I found particularly inspiring: http://www.howtobecomewildlypopular.com/2013/02/24/reddit-treasure-trove-the-7-subreddits-that-will-change-your-life/

744,GetMotivated,Needed a job. I went out and created my own position!,"I built a website for a someone recently (freelance), and while at their company, I noticed they had a lot of IT issues. Computer viruses, printers not working, things like that. So I created a single page outlining all the reasons they needed to bring me on as the IT department. I laid everything out that I thought I could do for them on a typical day, week, month. I then presented it to the owner, the man I had been dealing with for the website.

The owner really liked it, and had a staff meeting proposing the idea of bringing me on. They found a few more things I could do for them. So I officially start Monday. It's for almost 1/2 the pay of my last job, but it will at least cover rent during these hard times. 

It feels good knowing I walked in, said ""You need to hire me"" and made my own position at a 40+year old company. They deal with millions of dollars a year and huge companies. I'm excited.
"
746,GetMotivated,Does it take less than 20 minutes?,"Then do it.  Right now.


Whenever you think ""I should do x"" and x takes less than 20 minutes to do then just do it.  Not later, not tonight, not tomorrow, right fucking now.




Hmm, there are a few dishes in the sink...  **Wash them!**

This room could use a vacuuming... **Bust that shit out!**

That girl just smiled at me, I should say hi... **Hi! Do you like golf?**

I should study for school... **Study for 20 minutes!**


If you think of something you should do and it would take awhile, **write it down!**  The physical act of writing things down makes you more likely to do it.

It might seem overwhelming at first because there are probably a lot of little things around the house that need to get done, but after a few days you should have all the non-daily tasks knocked out and it will be good.

It's a new day wolves - **Get after it!**


*Edit - I used the golf line one time with one girl, don't read too much into it..."
756,GetMotivated,Strangely inspiring quote from Louis C.K's AMA,"When someone asked him about reddit:
&gt;I just have to much to do to roam around stuff like this. It seems like a great thing. I just can't do it. I killed my facebook page years ago because time clicking around is just dead time. Your brain isn't resting and it isn't doing. I think people have to get their heads around this thing. All this unmitigated input is hurting folks. My opinion.

Need I say more? I'm going outside now."
763,GetMotivated,You won't believe what made my today today,"I was sitting in my physics lecture and I could barely keep my eyes open, I was exhausted from studying all night and getting little to no sleep for the fourth day in a row. I had that sinking feeling of despair and frustration because I just couldn't understand the current material no matter how hard I tried and exams were right around the corner. I felt sick, tired and rife with mental fog, an overall terrible day and stressed to all hell. It might not seem like much, but the past few weeks really caught up with me all at once.

When the lecture ended, I walked outside in a pretty dismal mood, and to make everything worse it was pouring down rain! Not only was I tired, stressed, hungry and miserable, now I was soaking wet. I made it about 30 steps from the lecture hall when out of nowhere I felt this giant raindrop smack right into the side of my face. Only, when I went to brush it off, it turned out it wasn't a raindrop at all. 


A seagull had been flying overhead and out of the crowd of nearly 150 people around me, chose to fling its bird shit right at my face and all over my sweater. In the rain!


And that's what did it, I just stood there wiping this bird shit off of my face, and all I could think was *""ARE YOU KIDDING ME.* WHAT ARE THE ODDS?!""

What are the odds that all of these things happened in a row? I found it so hilarious that I burst out laughing while standing there in the street, in the rain, tired, stressed and covered in birdshit. I couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the afternoon. It was the best thing that could have happened to me and I knew it right at that instant.


It made me think about everything, the fact that I am a tiny self aware bag of meat, standing on a floating rock zipping around a giant fireball of a sun, in a galaxy, one among many billions. How absurd it is that I even exist, let alone experience rain soaked torpedo seagull shit splatter across my face."
778,GetMotivated,This is your great battle. ,"We as humans have a tendency to look toward the future, to what can be. To what we WANT. We wonder what it will be like to get there. Maybe it's a beautiful body. Maybe it's a degree. Maybe it's a new job. Maybe it's to finish a book. Maybe to play the guitar. Whatever it is, we fantasize about that moment when the battle is finished and we can enjoy what our hard work has wrought. 

But here's one thing about that success. We also have a tendency to think that the true challenge lies just around the next corner. 

Once you've lost a few pounds of fat, then you can start adding muscle. Once you've gotten into the habit of writing, then you can start on that epic novel. Once you've built up the callouses, then you can learn guitar properly. Once you've got your internal clock sorted, then you'll apply for more jobs. 

We think of the truly hard part as being in the future, some moment where our ""preparation"" will have led to our being ready to smash the demons that stand in our way and achieve success. We think of what we're facing today, right now, as a step along the way, toward that success, toward that state of being that we so desperately want. 

But it's not a step. Today is all there is. Right now is all there is. This is your great battle. There is no moment in your mission that will be more challenging than the one right in front of you. It's all you need to deal with. What you're thinking of, right now - that's it. That's your great battle. 

If you're looking to lose weight and you're having a craving for a candy bar, this is your great battle. 

If you're looking for a job and staying up late instead of getting up early, this is your great battle. 

If you're looking for more than friendship but are having trouble telling that person how you feel, this is your great battle. 

The stories of our culture revolve around grand deeds. Slaying dragons, defeating tyranny, overcoming unspeakable odds. Those are great battles too. Take your inspiration from them. They are the exact same as your great battle. It's standing right in front of you, right now. 

""Once more into the fray. 
Into the greatest battle you'll ever know.
We live and die on this day.
We live and die on this day.""

There will never be a greater moment than the one you're about to live. Conquer it. Your success lies in simply fighting the great battle, every single day of your life. "
780,GetMotivated,"[Strategy] Get ready in the morning, even if you don't have anywhere to be.","Days off/weekends can be a paradox. Not having to go to work sounds like a great time to get things done or be productive right? And yet, many of us lie in bed for half the day. When we wake up, we mull around the house in shorts and tee shirts, probably watching TV, playing video games, internet, whatever. Before long you have a day wasted.

So here's a strategy: On a day off, get up at the same time you would have if you had to go to work/school. Don't just get up though. Get ready for your day. Cook breakfast, shower, brush your teeth, get dressed. Do whatever you do to get ready on a normal day.

This gets you ready to take on the world on days you have to work/school, so why not get yourself ready to take on the world on days off too? There is plenty to do on a day off, and this is a great way to open yourself up to it and not waste a precious day.

EDIT: I understand there are those who have exhausting fulltime jobs or children in their lives (or both!). This strategy is really for redditors who are unemployed or even underemployed. It's a pretty vicious cycle to be caught in when you have so much free time and yet you end up wasting it anyways."
782,GetMotivated,You know what the best part of being human is?,"The fact that no matter how bad you are at something, you can always improve. 

We're designed to get better at things with practice. We're designed to push ourselves, and through pushing ourselves, we increase the limit. 

You work out, you gain muscle.

You play an instrument, you play better. 

You run, you can run farther.

You think, you think smarter.

Anything at all, the more you do it, the better you can do it. See those athletes who kick soccer balls into basketball hoops? They started out the same as everybody else. Weedy little kids. But they had a burning passion, and they kept at it. Now they can backflip through car windows. You've seen it, and you know, you can too, if you keep at it.

To quote Adventure Time, ""Sucking at something is the first step to being kinda good at something.""

And that's why I fucking love being human."

Concert pianist James Rhodes, writing in the Guardian, details how he spent ten years working in a city-based corporate job ('Don Draper albeit a few inches shorter and a few women fewer') before packing it all in to fulfil his life-long ambition.

Don't compare yourself to the guy next to you in the gym. 

Don't compare yourself to your idols, or your heroes.

Don't even compare yourself to the you of bygone years, of that guy that was once that fast, that strong.

You write out your problem, I send you a motivational video! I've received phenomenal feedback from people who took me up on my offer. Since this subreddit has quite a substantial user base, this thread might blow the fuck up. Please understand that I am the only person who records the videos, so I might be getting to your video a little later than originally anticipated. 

If you decide to message me, please state whether I can make the video public on my channel or unlisted. If unlisted, only you'll be able to see the video when I send you a link to it. 

As of today, I've made 40 motivational speeches to redditors. I have found by creating these motivational videos that this is my passion. Do not hesitate to message me even if you think I'm overwhelmed! I have the next 2 days off and I fully intend to use the majority of my time making motivational videos for you, :).

[Here is my youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP8NEQfikZawvZoxJkHGxLw?feature=mhee). I've created 2 public videos, one to say thank you, while the other is for suicidewatch. I guess it will be a taste of the kind of video you'll receive from me if you decide to message me! 

Cheers.

**Edit #1 @ 9:44 p.m EASTERN TIME.** 
Since this thread began, I've recorded 10 motivational videos! The issue though is that there is about 3 times the number of messages waiting to be replied to, O.O. I need to step away from my computer, and depending on how alert I am when I come back, I may record more tonight. I've been drinking a metric fuck ton of tea to give you the best possible motivational speech I can conjure up! I will be recording the majority of the day tomorrow, so rest assured your personalized motivational video is on its merry fucking way!

**Edit #2 @ 1:01 a.m EASTERN TIME**
 I took the time to read a lot of your messages so that I can literally sleep with ideas for great motivational speeches. Time for a good nights rest, and I will be recording as soon as I can. Tabulated number of messages at this current time is **115 requests for personalized motivational speeches**. 

Warning, what I say next may shock you.

**Do not let this deter you from sending me a message with your problems!** 

Cheers, I will talk to you tomorrow.

**Edit #3 @ 1:35 a.m EASTERN TIME**
 I'm calling in some help! Haha, you people never cease to amaze me with your ability to reach out to a stranger for help, :p. Two genuine friends of mine will be joining forces with me to give you a personalized motivational speeches tomorrow at varying times throughout the day, :).

**Edit #4 @ 12:57 p.m EASTERN TIME**
Heh, I just woke up! I guess I was a little more tired than originally anticipated. I need to run a couple of errands, and I'll be back for sure. Today is the day I will tackle a fuck ton of your problems with a motivational speech! When I woke up, I found that I now have a grand total of approximately 170 requests for motivational speeches, :O. I'll do my best to record as many as I possibly can when I come back, promise.

Whew, 4 straight hours of motivational videos and I've managed to record 14 videos in total! I'm done for tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow morning and the evening to record more. Keep being awesome. 

**Edit #7 @ 10:26 p.m EASTERN TIME**
So I've decided to count the number of request I have not been able to get to as of yet, and it's quite substantial. If I calculate how long it will take to get to all your requests, it will take approximately 55 to 60 hours of straight work. I am also in summer school and working 35 hours a week. 

I just want to let you know that I'm in this thing for the long run. I promise I will get back to every request I receive, no matter how long it takes. During this journey I'll formulate a game plan to figure out how to make this idea blow up.   

**Edit #8 @ 1:41 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 3**
Grr, I was only able to record 3 motivational videos before going to class. It's a 3 hour class, so I'll be back around 8 to record some more! I made one public, so hopefully that can tie you over until I get to your personalized motivation speech, :).

**Edit #9 @ 11:23 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 3**
I can't believe how I'm feeling overwhelmed while simultaneously being really motivated. Since inception of this thread, I've created 35 videos, but I still have a lot to go through. Rest assured, there will be a personalized motivational video for you. While it may take a lot longer than expected to have a video sent to you, I will get to you.  

**Edit #10 @ 2:17 a.m EASTERN TIME Day 4**
Oh man, a severe lack of free time is seriously hindering my ability to record messages! I'm working on them, slowly but surely.

**Edit #11 @ 11:53 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 5**
Worked on a couple of videos tonight, but unfortunately I haven't been sleeping a lot lately, so more motivational videos will come tomorrow after work!

**Edit #12 @ 1:44 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 7**
I honestly didn't think this was going to be as mentally draining as it has. While I still plan on getting videos to each and every one of you, I just need to factor in some time for myself so I can be at 100% when I give you motivational speeches! Cheers, and thank you for being so patient. "

852,GetMotivated,"Alright, deactivated my facebook, soon to quit this site, and start hitting the gym in pursuit of a 4.0 GPA this semester. Wish me luck. ","I've wasted far too many semesters saying ""I'll try harder next semester. I'll stop procrastination next semester. Next semester I will blah blah blah...""

Fuck that. I'm tired of wasting my life. This semester I'm taking calc 2, physics, and 2 programming classes. Shit is ridiculous. I spend a lot of time doing work. Its hard to explain, but I'm REALLY motivated to earn all A's this semester. I wake up at exactly 6:00am every day to prepare before my classes start. I'm hungry for success, I want it bad. But there are times when I get severely sidetracked by facebook and reddit.

Facebook - I spent too much trying to talk to people who no longer care about me, or trying to stay current with other people's lives. The few people who I truly care about, and the people who care about me, we see each other in real life. Or talk on the phone. It doesn't make sense for me to stay current with strangers who have no interest in me. At the end of the semester I'll activate the account again however. 

Reddit - damn. I love this site, but it too, is a distraction. 

I haven't been to the gym in a while, but I need to lose at least 30 pounds by the end of the year. When I look good, I feel good. I'm totally not content with my appearance and I feel like shit about it. Time to change that. 

Anyway, I understand that I CAN keep my facebook/reddit accounts active while still doing well in school. Sure, I know people will argue that. I used to have the same mentality too but it never got me anywhere. But I'm not that type of guy (anymore). I'm either going to devote myself 100% and succeed or I'm not going to do it at all. No half-assed effort. So this will likely be my last post until about December. Wish me luck guys.

So there I sat, fired for the first time in my life, for failing to meet expectations that were never clear to begin with.  I have a wife, a son, and that same morning, found out we had another precious life on the way.  The hour-long ride home, I sat there trying not to cry, worrying about how we could make it on my wife's income until I could find employment.

Wait, that's not what happened at all.  By the time I got home, I had lined up three meetings for later in the week with potential employers.  All three told me they didn't care about me being fired...they'd worked with me in the past and knew what I was worth.  I took all three of those meetings, and all three said they would move forward with me.

So, one week and one day after being shit-canned for the first time ever, I'm depositing my first retainer check from a new business partner.  I'll be designing his farm GPS/GIS infrastructure, migrating him to a new accounting program, and integrating a harvest management system.  

As I write this, another of those contacts is closing a round of investment in his farm for several million dollars...a relationship I began for him at the job I'd just been fired from.  The farmer will be using me to get his proverbial shit together for financials and technology.  That investment bank will be bringing me on as an independent consultant to get them in front of more investment opportunities.  Finally, another business contact will be using me to design and build his business plan and marketing materials for his new realty business.

One hour.  One measly hour after being fired, I'd set the wheels in motion for all of that.  I'll make more in the next year than I would have at my old job.  It won't be easy, but my family will not taste the pain of hunger and threadbare Christmases.  They WILL NOT have the life I was raised in.  Fuck defeat.  It's for weaker souls.

You can do this, whatever it might be.  You can get that job...finish your degree...ask her out...ace that final...lose that weight...assemble that Ikea chair.  Eat fear, shit success.  Good luck, my fellow wolves.

And I believe every man should ask himself: Am I willing to endure the pain of this struggle for the comforts and the rewards and the glory that go with achievement? Or shall I accept the uneasy and inadequate contentment that comes with mediocrity? Am I willing to pay the Price of Success?

904,GetMotivated,"Finally saw the Dark Knight Rises last night. For me, this was the most motivating quote of the movie (some spoilers).","Prisoner: You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong. It makes you weak.

Bruce Wayne: Why?

Prisoner: How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible without the most powerful impulse of the spirit- the fear of death?

Wayne: I do fear death. I fear dying here while my city burns and there's no one there to save it.

Prisoner: Then make the climb.

Wayne: How?

Prisoner: As the child did - without the rope. Then fear will find you again."
922,GetMotivated,Imagine..,"Imagine you walked into your room to find your twin sitting where you were sitting. Working on what you were working on.

Except.. He's not working like you were working, nowhere near. He is NOTHING like you. Infact, the STRENGTH you feel just by being in his presence, makes you whisper to yourself, ""woah"".

He has a look in eye, an uprightness to his posture and an spiritual energy that tells you, without any words spoken that he is getting what he wants. Whatever it is. Full stop.

Your hairs stand on end like you just came across a Lion, and he's staring right at you about to pounce. But you're twin is not even looking at you. He has no awareness of your presence. He is focused.

You know at this point that you're looking at something very strange. The likes of which, you have never seen live, in the flesh, before. 

He is not even an alpha male. He is something much bigger, much stronger than that.

He is greatness.

You get a sense standing next to him, that this is what it must have been like to stand next to Alexander The Great, Winston Churchill or Napoleon Bonaparte in their prime. 

But he is not them. He is you, down to the bone. There is nothing in him that is not in you.

You know this.

I know you do, deep down, we all do.

Despite this, the question always seems to remain.

Why aren't you that guy?

The answer is FEAR.

The only thing separating you from that guy is this four letter word. That's it.

So now decide.

Go and be that guy."
924,GetMotivated,How I got rid of my Social Anxiety.,"I've been getting asked about this pretty often, so I decided to make a post about it. 

My whole life I've been really shy. I hated it. I couldn't make phone calls. My family would be mad at me because I'd never talk to them. I would lose friends because I wouldn't make the effort to contact them. My work life suffered. If I saw an old friend at the mall I would hide. But I thought ""that's just the way I am."" 

But a few things happened in my life that showed me that I don't have to be like that if I don't want to. 

1. On my 28th Birthday, a friend gave me some mdma (Ecstasy).(I'm not recommending drugs here btw.) On it, I loved everyone, wanted to talk and touch everyone. I was the life of the party, a social butterfly. I wanted to be like that every day. 

2. Psychology. I've always loved social sciences, and it's proven that phobias are treatable. And that's what I had, an irrational fear of humans. :) (Mixed with low confidence)

3. Reddit. There's a lot of self-help subreddits that helped me. r/getmotivated, r/loveyourslef, r/TwoXchromosomes, and r/seduction. I know r/seduction has a bad reputation, but it really is made for people who have anxiety and undeveloped social skills, and teaches them how to be confident. 

4. I learned to dance. This is like a booster shot of liquid self-esteem. When you're able to just flail your arms and shake your booty without a care in the world as to what other people think about it. It's really freeing. 

So in the last two years, I've been on a mission to rid myself of my shyness. It's not completely gone, but I'm more than halfway there, and I've never been happier. It's fucking hard work, but omg is it worth it. 

Things I do to practice. 

- Look people in the eye when I talk to them. Always terrifying to me before, but gets easier pretty quickly. 

- Smile. It's cliché, but it has lots of positive effects. It makes your brain think you're happy, so it releases dopamine. People think you're friendly so they're more likely to talk to you. 

- Talk to All The People! Make small talk, then ask open-ended questions. Asking open ended questions is what makes a real connection with others possible. It allows you to really get to know someone. 

- Allow yourself to love yourself. Say supportive and positive things in your mind, or even out loud. Things like ""You're awesome!"", ""I'm the Boss!"", and things like that. [Self Fulfilling Prophecies work.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy) (Just don't become arrogant, you will if you take it too far.)

- Start liking people more. I used think I hated people. But I think that was just my brain making excuses because it was afraid of them. I saw a quote from Niel Gaiman that really resonated with me.

&gt;""Everyone has a secret world inside of them. All the people in the whole world, no matter how dull they seem on the outside, inside them they've got unimaginable, magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds.""

I now think that every single person, has at least one thing that they have in common with someone else. And that one thing can create a connection between those people that they can be friendly over. I think I'm actually turning into an extrovert."
926,GetMotivated,Today I saw a big girl running down the street.,"Today I saw a big girl running down the street. She must've been 5'9 and around 210 pounds in shorts and a wife beater tee, jogging down the street listening to her ipod. Clearly sweaty and uncomfortable, on the verge of stopping at any second and giving up. But she kept chugging along.

And I thought... Good for you. Keep it up. You're not sitting on the couch thinking you should do something about it anymore. You're not at some gym, *walking* on a treadmill trying harder to not sweat than you are at your workout. You're outside, hitting the pavement at 7am making a difference. You own, running girl."
933,GetMotivated,"Wolves, remember these 10 things.","1.Productivity = time spent on task * intensity with which you do the task

2.Believe in yourself, or no one else will.

3.Make the choice to be happy, no matter what is going on around you. Being sad does nothing, do what you can and let everything else go.

4.Remember your goals. Set them. Tackle them. Finish them. If you get discouraged, break it down into smaller goals. Finish no matter what. Do not make finishing a task, make it a habit.

5.Take care of your mind and body. Eat well. Stretch. Workout.

6.Take it one step at a time. Keep pushing.

7.You are what you consistently do.

8.Consistent small changes add up to big changes.

9.Never forget to have fun. Find the fun in anything. Remember perspective.

10.Any decision is better than no decision. Failure is better than not doing at all."
934,GetMotivated,"To those of you who are losing your motivation, or having trouble finding it in the first place, I am sharing my sincerest thoughts with you.","Sometimes you're discouraged. You lose sight of why you decided to work this hard in the first place. You forget your goals and intentions. You misplace that motivation that drove you in the first place.  

Sometimes, I know, all you want to do is give up. You've been climbing this mountain for who knows how long and you have no idea when you'll ever reach the top.  

But here's the thing. Stop climbing for a second and turn around.  

Look.  

Look at how far you've already come. Look at where you started. Look at how hard it was to start this journey in the first place. Look at how steep that mountain was at times but you kept pushing through it anyway. Look at it all and be proud of yourself. Find the joy in even the smallest of accomplishments. Congratulate yourself. Pat yourself on the back, damn it.   

Whether you're almost at the top, or whether you've just started, do not undermine how much you've accomplished.   

If you give up, you'll just roll down that hill and be farther to your goal, not closer to it. If you let go, you'll have to start all over again.    

You've made it through so much already. You can't stop now. You don't want to have to start over again.   

You tripped? You messed up? You skipped a day? A week? A month? You've regressed? So, what? This is YOUR mountain. Nobody else's. You're not a failure. You're a wolf. You're going to get back up with even more willpower than when you started and you're going to KEEP GOING.    

Think of future you, standing up there with the utmost pride and purest happiness. Think of her/him telling you not to give up. Yelling at you to get up and keep going. Thanking YOU for doing all of this for YOURSELF.   

Don't think about your excuses. None of them are reasons.  

""Oh, but I...""  

""No, you don't understand, it's different for me, I...""  

""No, seriously, listen, this JUST happened to me, and I...""  

No. You listen. You will not change unless you decide to change. Your life will not change unless you decide to change it yourself.   

There will always be reasons why you shouldn't do it. Only think of the reasons why you should.  

Change and improvement are 99% mental. Your legs will run if you tell them to. Your lips will speak if you tell them to. Your lungs will not collapse. Your arms will not fall off. Your unhealthy food/alcohol/drugs will not run away. It'll be there tomorrow. You don't need it. You don't have to have it right now. You're in control. You're the writer of your own destiny. Just do it one day at a time. You can conquer this.  

Seriously. You can't expect to knock down a wall by tapping on it. You need to get at it with full force.  

Rock on, dear wolves.  

Rock. On.

Edit 1: Wow. I feel that I really have to say to everyone, ""you are so welcome."" I was just getting down on myself yesterday and decided to stop and give myself a little pep talk. Started typing it up on here immediately in the hopes of helping to pick someone back up along the way as well.

969,GetMotivated,Be a man,"I don't know what it is. I don't know what it was. But for all my life I haven't been a man.

At any point in my life I can say ""this, this is why I didn't need to grow up"".

I was protected by my parents.

I was protected by the money I earned.

I was protected by people going easy on me.

And never did I take responsibility. Never did I work hard. Never did I do things because they needed to be done - instead I just did the minimum to get around - and for the rest found excuses.

I have lived like a child, all my life.

And I am in my twenties and still I live like a child.

I complain about the things I lack - instead of working for them.

I complain about the things others don't do - instead of doing them myself.

I worry about what might come - but I don't plan anything.

I pity myself in my sadness or worries - instead of acting upon them.

I wonder why I sit alone at home - instead of going out and making friends.

I hate myself for not learning the skills or languages I want to learn - instead of making the effort.

All my life I have lived like a child. All my life I was too scared or worried or lazy or distracted or immature to stand up and say:

This is what I want, and I will make it happen.

This is the person I want to meet and I will meet him.

This is the job I want and I will fight my ass off to get it.

This is the book I need to know and I will sit down and I will not eat or drink until I have finished it.

This is the world I want to conquer and I will not give up until I have conquered it.

Now is the time. Now is the time that I need to stand up and fight.

Why now?

Because else it is too late.

The longer I wait, the longer I keep thinking and speaking and acting like a child, the longer I will stay a child.

The longer I wait, the more unreachable will my goals become.

The longer I wait, the shorter is the time that I can be a man.

The longer I wait, the more of my life will I have wasted.

Today is the day I will become a man.

Today is the day I will think like a man, speak like a man and act like a man.

Today and every day from now:

I will be there for those that need me.

I will stand up for what is right.

I will do what needs to be done.

I will fight for what I want.

I will persevere, even when things get hard.

I will work even when I feel lazy.

I will do sport even when my body aches.

I will learn even when my mind feels numb.

I will meet people even when I'm scared.

I will speak when I need to speak.

I will work when I need to work.

I will be what I want to be.

But I've never been a defeatist. I've been slowly revamping my life and getting to where I want to be.

Yesterday I signed a lease on a new house. I've been gainfully employed for almost a year, I saved up for an excellent bicycle, my GPA last semester was a 3.8, I fixed and sold my car, I've made tons of new friends and developed healthy, meaningful relationships. I'm making art again and life is honestly a little bit too beautiful right now.

I don't know if this is necessarily the right subreddit, or if anybody is even interested. I kinda just wanted to brag :P

I'll give just a bit of a back-story/context. I'm going to include some relevant links just in case any of you want to see the things I'm referring to.

Retroactively, I called this series *Penpal*.

Not too long after finishing the stories, I began revising and expanding them into a novel. In April, 2012 I ran a [Kickstarter for the book](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1153987072/penpal), which, mostly thanks to NoSleep, was a huge success. In August, I [published the book on Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Penpal-Dathan-Auerbach/dp/098554550X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349741729&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=penpal).

Before the book had even launched, however (and I haven't told anyone until today), I was contacted by a producer named Rich Middlemas, who won an Oscar for the documentary Undefeated this year. After talking for a while, we reached an agreement, and he is now officially on board to produce the film adaptation of *Penpal*! Rich has just started shopping the book around in an attempt to get it set up in Hollywood, so we've still got a ways to go, but I'm hopeful that we'll get there.

I never anticipated things getting this far, and I haven't forgotten for a second that the people of Reddit are who made this possible. The support I've gotten so far has been incredible, and whatever comes of all of this, I'm proud that it started on Reddit.

83,movies,"Kevin Smith on George Carlin and ""Dogma"". I rolled a tear.","[via Facebook](http://i.imgur.com/ILs4P.png)

This is George Carlin as Cardinal Glick during the DOGMA shoot in Pittsburgh, circa 1998.

The first time I met George Carlin was May of 1997 at the Conan O'Brien show, back when they used to shoot it in New York City. I was there to promote CHASING AMY and when I found out Carlin was gonna be on the same show, I nearly shit myself. He'd always been a hero and a role model to me, so I brought a DOGMA script along in hopes of asking Curious George to play Cardinal Glick - the marketing maven behind the Buddy Christ. 

But shortly before the show, Brenda - George's wife of 36 years - lost her battle with liver caner. Ever the professional, George kept his Conan booking, but you could tell he was heartbroken. I didn't bug him with DOGMA that night.

I'd meet the master again a month later at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles. He'd already read DOGMA and we were grabbing lunch to talk about whether or not he wanted to be in it. He said he was into it but had one request.

George asked if Cardinal Glick could have a bandage on his finger, which would hide George Carlin's wedding band. Because, he said, he wasn't ready to take it off just yet.

NOTE: I did NOT write this post, I just found it on the web.

Link: http://cavalorn.livejournal.com/584135.html#cutid1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Prometheus contains such a huge amount of mythic resonance that it effectively obscures a more conventional plot. I'd like to draw your attention to the use of motifs and callbacks in the film that not only enrich it, but offer possible hints as to what was going on in otherwise confusing scenes.

Let's begin with the eponymous titan himself, Prometheus. He was a wise and benevolent entity who created mankind in the first place, forming the first humans from clay. The Gods were more or less okay with that, until Prometheus gave them fire. This was a big no-no, as fire was supposed to be the exclusive property of the Gods. As punishment, Prometheus was chained to a rock and condemned to have his liver ripped out and eaten every day by an eagle. (His liver magically grew back, in case you were wondering.)

Fix that image in your mind, please: the giver of life, with his abdomen torn open. We'll be coming back to it many times in the course of this article.

The ethos of the titan Prometheus is one of willing and necessary sacrifice for life's sake. That's a pattern we see replicated throughout the ancient world. J G Frazer wrote his lengthy anthropological study, The Golden Bough, around the idea of the Dying God - a lifegiver who voluntarily dies for the sake of the people. It was incumbent upon the King to die at the right and proper time, because that was what heaven demanded, and fertility would not ensue if he did not do his royal duty of dying.

Now, consider the opening sequence of Prometheus. We fly over a spectacular vista, which may or may not be primordial Earth. According to Ridley Scott, it doesn't matter. A lone Engineer at the top of a waterfall goes through a strange ritual, drinking from a cup of black goo that causes his body to disintegrate into the building blocks of life. We see the fragments of his body falling into the river, twirling and spiralling into DNA helices. 

Ridley Scott has this to say about the scene: 'That could be a planet anywhere. All he’s doing is acting as a gardener in space. And the plant life, in fact, is the disintegration of himself. If you parallel that idea with other sacrificial elements in history – which are clearly illustrated with the Mayans and the Incas – he would live for one year as a prince, and at the end of that year, he would be taken and donated to the gods in hopes of improving what might happen next year, be it with crops or weather, etcetera.'

Can we find a God in human history who creates plant life through his own death, and who is associated with a river? It's not difficult to find several, but the most obvious candidate is Osiris, the epitome of all the Frazerian 'Dying Gods'.

And we wouldn't be amiss in seeing the first of the movie's many Christian allegories in this scene, either. The Engineer removes his cloak before the ceremony, and hesitates before drinking the cupful of genetic solvent; he may well have been thinking 'If it be Thy will, let this cup pass from me.'

So, we know something about the Engineers, a founding principle laid down in the very first scene: acceptance of death, up to and including self-sacrifice, is right and proper in the creation of life. Prometheus, Osiris, John Barleycorn, and of course the Jesus of Christianity are all supposed to embody this same principle. It is held up as one of the most enduring human concepts of what it means to be 'good'.

Seen in this light, the perplexing obscurity of the rest of the film yields to an examination of the interwoven themes of sacrifice, creation, and preservation of life. We also discover, through hints, exactly what the nature of the clash between the Engineers and humanity entailed.

The crew of the Prometheus discover an ancient chamber, presided over by a brooding solemn face, in which urns of the same black substance are kept. A mural on the wall presents an image which, if you did as I asked earlier on, you will recognise instantly: the lifegiver with his abdomen torn open. Go and look at it here to refresh your memory. Note the serenity on the Engineer's face here. 

And there's another mural there, one which shows a familiar xenomorph-like figure. This is the Destroyer who mirrors the Creator, I think - the avatar of supremely selfish life, devouring and destroying others purely to preserve itself. As Ash puts it: 'a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality.'

Through Shaw and Holloway's investigations, we learn that the Engineers not only created human life, they supervised our development. (How else are we to explain the numerous images of Engineers in primitive art, complete with star diagram showing us the way to find them?) We have to assume, then, that for a good few hundred thousand years, they were pretty happy with us. They could have destroyed us at any time, but instead, they effectively invited us over; the big pointy finger seems to be saying 'Hey, guys, when you're grown up enough to develop space travel, come see us.' Until something changed, something which not only messed up our relationship with them but caused their installation on LV-223 to be almost entirely wiped out.

From the Engineers' perspective, so long as humans retained that notion of self-sacrifice as central, we weren't entirely beyond redemption. But we went and screwed it all up, and the film hints at when, if not why: the Engineers at the base died two thousand years ago. That suggests that the event that turned them against us and led to the huge piles of dead Engineers lying about was one and the same event. We did something very, very bad, and somehow the consequences of that dreadful act accompanied the Engineers back to LV-223 and massacred them.

If you have uneasy suspicions about what 'a bad thing approximately 2,000 years ago' might be, then let me reassure you that you are right. An astonishing excerpt from the Movies.com interview with Ridley Scott:

Movies.com: We had heard it was scripted that the Engineers were targeting our planet for destruction because we had crucified one of their representatives, and that Jesus Christ might have been an alien. Was that ever considered?

Ridley Scott: We definitely did, and then we thought it was a little too on the nose. But if you look at it as an “our children are misbehaving down there” scenario, there are moments where it looks like we’ve gone out of control, running around with armor and skirts, which of course would be the Roman Empire. And they were given a long run. A thousand years before their disintegration actually started to happen. And you can say, ""Let's send down one more of our emissaries to see if he can stop it."" Guess what? They crucified him.

Yeah. The reason the Engineers don't like us any more is that they made us a Space Jesus, and we broke him. Reader, that's not me pulling wild ideas out of my arse. That's RIDLEY SCOTT.

So, imagine poor crucified Jesus, a fresh spear wound in his side. Oh, hey, there's the 'lifegiver with his abdomen torn open' motif again. That's three times now: Prometheus, Engineer mural, Jesus Christ. And I don't think I have to mention the 'sacrifice in the interest of giving life' bit again, do I? Everyone on the same page? Good.

So how did our (in the context of the film) terrible murderous act of crucifixion end up wiping out all but one of the Engineers back on LV-223? Presumably through the black slime, which evidently models its behaviour on the user's mental state. Create unselfishly, accepting self-destruction as the cost, and the black stuff engenders fertile life. But expose the potent black slimy stuff to the thoughts and emotions of flawed humanity, and 'the sleep of reason produces monsters'. We never see the threat that the Engineers were fleeing from, we never see them killed other than accidentally (decapitation by door), and we see no remaining trace of whatever killed them. Either it left a long time ago, or it reverted to inert black slime, waiting for a human mind to reactivate it.

The black slime reacts to the nature and intent of the being that wields it, and the humans in the film didn't even know that they WERE wielding it. That's why it remained completely inert in David's presence, and why he needed a human proxy in order to use the stuff to create anything. The black goo could read no emotion or intent from him, because he was an android.

Shaw's comment when the urn chamber is entered - 'we've changed the atmosphere in the room' - is deceptively informative. The psychic atmosphere has changed, because humans - tainted, Space Jesus-killing humans - are present. The slime begins to engender new life, drawing not from a self-sacrificing Engineer but from human hunger for knowledge, for more life, for more everything. Little wonder, then, that it takes serpent-like form. The symbolism of a corrupting serpent, turning men into beasts, is pretty unmistakeable.

Refusal to accept death is anathema to the Engineers. Right from the first scene, we learned their code of willing self-sacrifice in accord with a greater purpose. When the severed Engineer head is temporarily brought back to life, its expression registers horror and disgust. Cinemagoers are confused when the head explodes, because it's not clear why it should have done so. Perhaps the Engineer wanted to die again, to undo the tainted human agenda of new life without sacrifice."
172,movies,"Alfred Hitchcock, in a conversation with French director Francois Truffaut, explains surprise vs. suspense","We are now having a very innocent little chat. Let us suppose that there is a bomb underneath this table between us. Nothing happens, and then all of a sudden, ""Boom!""
     There is an explosion. The public is *surprised*, but prior to this surprise, it has seen an absolutely ordinary scene of no special consequence. Now, let us take a *suspense* situation. The bomb is underneath the table and the public *knows* it, probably because they have seen the anarchist place it there. The public is *aware* that the bomb is going to explode at one o'clock and there is a clock in the decor. The public can see that it is a quarter to one. In these conditions this same innocuous conversation becomes fascinating because the public is participating in the scene. The audience is longing to warn the characters on the screen: ""You shouldn't be talking about such trivial matters. There's a bomb beneath you and it's about to explode!""
      In the first scene we have given the public fifteen seconds of *surprise* at the moment of the explosion. In the second we have provided them with fifteen minutes of *suspense*. The conclusion is that whenever possible the public must be informed. Except when the surprise is a twist, that is, when the unexpected ending is, in itself, the highlight of the story.

177,movies,PSA: Saying there is a twist at the end of something is still a SPOILER.,"When I watch movies (or tv series, books, video games, etc.), I try to go in knowing nothing about it. I want everything to be fresh. Obviously not all plot details can be avoided, and there's a fine line between what is a spoiler and what isn't, but what I really hate is when people tell you about a twist at the end, thinking it's okay if they don't tell you what the twist is. But if you're aware a twist is coming, the twist loses half its impact (e.g. ""Oh man, that movie is so good. There's such a good twist at the end. You'll never see it coming.""). You're not approaching the story from the same vantage point anymore because you're looking out for a twist; you're no longer taking the movie at face value. I just thought this was something everyone should be aware of, especially in this subreddit."

332,movies,Can we petition Disney to release the ORIGINAL unaltered Star Wars on Blu-ray now that they own the rights?,"Like the title says I'd love to get the original trilogy before all the re-release stuff that they put into it. Watch it as it should be, not as it is now.  I don't know all the legal stuff with the rights and everything, but I think it'd probably sell well."
334,movies,Christopher Nolan's goodbye letter to The Batman Trilogy.,"This was from the foreword of the The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy book:

Alfred. Gordon. Lucius. Bruce . . . Wayne. Names that have come to mean so much to me. Today, I’m three weeks from saying a final good-bye to these characters and their world. It’s my son’s ninth birthday. He was born as the Tumbler was being glued together in my garage from random parts of model kits. Much time, many changes. A shift from sets where some gunplay or a helicopter were extraordinary events to working days where crowds of extras, building demolitions, or mayhem thousands of feet in the air have become familiar.

People ask if we’d always planned a trilogy. This is like being asked whether you had planned on growing up, getting married, having kids. The answer is complicated. When David and I first started cracking open Bruce’s story, we flirted with what might come after, then backed away, not wanting to look too deep into the future. I didn’t want to know everything that Bruce couldn’t; I wanted to live it with him. I told David and Jonah to put everything they knew into each film as we made it. The entire cast and crew put all they had into the first film. Nothing held back. Nothing saved for next time. They built an entire city. Then Christian and Michael and Gary and Morgan and Liam and Cillian started living in it. Christian bit off a big chunk of Bruce Wayne’s life and made it utterly compelling. He took us into a pop icon’s mind and never let us notice for an instant the fanciful nature of Bruce’s methods.

I never thought we’d do a second—how many good sequels are there? Why roll those dice? But once I knew where it would take Bruce, and when I started to see glimpses of the antagonist, it became essential. We re-assembled the team and went back to Gotham. It had changed in three years. Bigger. More real. More modern. And a new force of chaos was coming to the fore. The ultimate scary clown, as brought to terrifying life by Heath. We’d held nothing back, but there were things we hadn’t been able to do the first time out—a Batsuit with a flexible neck, shooting on Imax. And things we’d chickened out on—destroying the Batmobile, burning up the villain’s blood money to show a complete disregard for conventional motivation. We took the supposed security of a sequel as license to throw caution to the wind and headed for the darkest corners of Gotham.

I never thought we’d do a third—are there any great second sequels? But I kept wondering about the end of Bruce’s journey, and once David and I discovered it, I had to see it for myself. We had come back to what we had barely dared whisper about in those first days in my garage. We had been making a trilogy. I called everyone back together for another tour of Gotham. Four years later, it was still there. It even seemed a little cleaner, a little more polished. Wayne Manor had been rebuilt. Familiar faces were back—a little older, a little wiser . . . but not all was as it seemed.

Gotham was rotting away at its foundations. A new evil bubbling up from beneath. Bruce had thought Batman was not needed anymore, but Bruce was wrong, just as I had been wrong. The Batman had to come back. I suppose he always will.

Michael, Morgan, Gary, Cillian, Liam, Heath, Christian . . . Bale. Names that have come to mean so much to me. My time in Gotham, looking after one of the greatest and most enduring figures in pop culture, has been the most challenging and rewarding experience a filmmaker could hope for. I will miss the Batman. I like to think that he’ll miss me, but he’s never been particularly sentimental.

346,movies,"I rewatched ""Drive"", noticed something about the colour palette","When I first watched Drive, it gripped me with how beautifully it was shot. For all its lighting and camera work, there was something else that I knew I was subconsciously seeing but not realizing. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that made it so pleasing to the eyes. Now it hit me.

Remember that concept and overuse of orange and blue that we've seen in various movies and posters alike? Drive did it nicely without being obnoxious and distracting.

I took a few stills (spoiler-free) to show what I mean!


http://imgur.com/a/C3jUq


I was surprised that I only noticed it the second viewing, considering that you could really snap any frame and see it very clearly. I personally found that it worked really well with the aesthetic of the film, and the colour grading was elegantly and subtly done (non-intrusive).

Lastly, if you haven't seen it yet, you should!


Cheers!


EDIT: For all those of you who are saying ""wow you noticed orange/blue in a hollywood film, so what?"", yes, orange/blue has been over-used and is very VERY common in Hollywood films. That is NOT the point here. It's about the level of execution and how it was done. Rather than relying completely on post-production colour grading to achieve this effect (which when done badly results in an over-saturated distracting picture,) they used key objects, costumes, backgrounds, and background objects for a more natural look and to create depth. And when the post grading shows, it's nicely done and not intrusive. That is something I haven't seen used so well many pictures.


EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking for higher res stills. I didn't think this post would become popular so I didn't bother uploading high quality shots, but if you want 1080p stills from these or any other parts of the movie, feel free to pm me and I'll be happy to send them!"

391,movies,"The Iron Giant was based on the premise ""What if a gun had a soul?""","On creative freedom from Wikipedia: The financial failure of Warner Bros.' previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, whose cost overruns and production nightmares made the company reconsider their commitment to feature animation, helped shape The Iron Giant's production considerably. In a 2003 interview, writer Tim McCanlies recalled ""Quest for Camelot did so badly that everybody backed away from animation and fired people. Suddenly we had no executive anymore on Iron Giant, which was great because Brad got to make his movie. Because nobody was watching."" Bird, who regarded Camelot as ""trying to emulate the Disney style,"" attributed the creative freedom on The Iron Giant to the bad experience of Quest for Camelot, stating: ""I caught them at a very strange time, and in many ways a fortuitous time."" By the time The Iron Giant entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. However, although the production was watched closely, Bird commented ""They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good."" Bird regarded the tradeoff as having ""one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule,"" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as ""fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.""

MORE COOL STUFF: Vin Diesel voiced the Iron Giant. Jennifer Aniston voiced Hogarth's mom. Eli Marienthal voiced Hogarth. Harry Connick, Jr. voiced Dean McCoppin, and Christopher McDonald voiced Kent Mansley.  **It is the highest-rated movie any of them were ever in**, according to RottenTomatoes.

The movie is hand-animated in 2D except for the giant, who is 3D and fully computer-animated to look like he was drawn.

By the way, Brad Bird also directed my two favorite Pixar films, The Incredibles and Ratatouille! so yeah guy pretty much owned my childhood

EDIT: whoa, unexpected upvotes! I posted this after watching the movie with my family last night. After about the seventh or eighth time I commented on the amazing CGI, art, and lighting direction, and then said that Iron Giant was a better critique of American Exceptionalism than Bioshock Infinite, my little brother who had never watched the movie before told me to shut up so he could actually enjoy it.

425,movies,"For the past couple days, I have been researching the average time it takes for a movie to be released on DVD following its theatrical release going back to 1998. Results are pretty interesting...","It's really no secret that the time from theatrical release to DVD release is much shorter than it used to be. But I wanted to know how much shorter.

Also a [line graph!](http://imgur.com/lXeGp)


&gt; By popular demand, a [graph with both my original numbers and with adjusted inflation numbers.](http://imgur.com/ir6KW) As you can see, not a big difference. All of the adjusted numbers used 1998 dollar values.


The 2012 numbers are through August.

To save time and not research every single movie released since 1998, I limited my choices to movies that made at least $100 million in worldwide box office, or fairly close to that. I wanted to go back further but I was unable to consistently find data.


**Interesting things to note:**

*2003 saw the biggest drop in wait time, averaging 153 days from 176 days in 2002.

*2012 is on track for the shortest average wait time so far, averaging 115 days.

*The first movie to crack 90 days was the 2003 movie Mona Lisa Smile, released theatrically on December 19, 2003 then on DVD on March 9, 2004. A wait of 81 days.

*The shortest overall wait was the 2007 Ben Stiller movie The Heartbreak Kid, released theatrically on October 5, 2007 and released on DVD on December 21, 2007, just 77 days later.

*The longest wait was the 2002 movie The Santa Clause 2, released theatrically November 1, 2002 and released on DVD November 18, 2003. A wait of 382 days, though not unusual for a Christmas movie.

*Also not surprisingly, the number of movies hitting $100 million in worldwide box office has risen a lot since 1998.

Make your additions in the comments! I'll continue to update this list.

**Edit:** Updated at 3:50 PM, EDT. This list has become quite long and contains too many movies without trailers. I will try to organize it a bit better later, and might make it into a Google Calendar."
486,movies,Can we keep the up/down votes in /r/movies as thumbs for the rest of the year in memory of Roger Ebert?,"I think this would be a cool way to honor him. I just noticed the up/down votes are thumbs, it's awesome! Let's leave it this way until the end of the year. 
"
503,movies,"In the Terminator franchise, what does Skynet actually want?","Reflecting on the Terminator franchise, it strikes me that I don't know what Skynet is trying to accomplish. With the Matrix, I sort of understand what the machines were doing. They were persecuted by mankind and basically worked to keep mankind in an electronic stasis so they'd stop being a nuisance while they thrived as a cyber-society. Honestly, it's hard to consider the machines pure antagonists because humanity started that fight and they don't even want us all dead.

But Skynet... it's a war machine that never stops. Is it because it's a military machine and it's core programming is war? Does it have a vision beyond conquering the resistance? No more humans... and then what?"

593,movies,Jackie Chan announces that he will continue making action movies!,"""Hello All my friends and fans,

Yesterday in my press conference in Cannes for Chinese 12 Zodiac I said that this movie was my last big action movie. 

Today I was shocked when I woke up to read all the news coverage that I was retiring from doing Action movies.

I just want to let everyone know that I am not retiring from doing action movies. What I meant to say is that I need to do less of the life risking stunts on my movies. After all these years of doing so many stunts and breaking so many bones, I need to take better care of my body so I can keep working.

I will continue to do international action movies.

And I will keep improving my English :-)

I love all of you!""

Jackie

598,movies,I urge you again to boycott hollywood - they are using our money to curtail our rights. Stop giving it to them.,"Yesterday I started [a new subreddit to try and encourage people to join me in boycotting hollywood](http://www.reddit.com/r/boycotthollywood/). I really think if we don't show the big players in the entertainment industry how we feel, if we allow them to continue to take us for granted, we will inevitably be the losers. So here is my proposal:  
  
Hollywood today is dominated by 6 big studios. They are (in order of market share) Warner Bros., Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Disney, Sony and NBC Universal.
  
We all know about Murdoch's anti - Obama platform - he has given his ""journalists"" (is there anything more powerful than inverted commas that can be used here?) carte blanc to attack Obama since the day he was sworn in. We know that NBC is a major backer of SOPA and we know that Disney has already had copyright law in the US changed to protect its older works. The others are no doubt well behind SOPA/PIPA as well.
  
These are not the only studios but together they account for about 80% of the movie industry in the USA.
  
My proposal is, we boycott these studios until SOPA/PIPA is dead or until they publicly oppose these bills (which is highly unlikely to happen).   
  
A lot of mention has been made of watching films for free. I think this is a personal choice. I don't want to recommend it, because it reinforces the arguments the studios are making. I am personally going to just refuse to watch anything made by these studios. Batman? Fuck it! I can go without.   
  
I'll play games instead of watching movies. Give your pocket money to Good Guy Gabe instead of Scumbag Rupert!
  
  
Please make a new post in this subreddit telling us how you plan to avoid hollywood, and what you'll be doing instead, and try to promote this boycott wherever you can. If we want to make a difference,we need more people, and more wallets.  
  
 Because in the end, they are spending **our** money to try and curtail** our** rights. Time to stop giving them their ammunition.  
  
EDIT: **I am not advocating piracy. I will happily pay for a quality product.** I am upset because hollywood want to stifle online innovation because they are too lazy. They have had it too easy for too long. Don't come here to post ""I love piracy"". This debate is not about piracy.       
  
EDIT2: Nice to make the front page but I'd prefer if everyone actually subscribed to the subreddit!  
  
EDIT3: Not about piracy.  
 
EDIT4: Not about piracy.  
  
UBEREDIT: Not about piracy. Allow me to elucidate again.   
  
Democracry in America is no longer about people, it is about buying power. One dollar, one vote! Hollywood (and others) lobby for SOPA and it gets onto the voting agenda. Silicon Valley outspends them and everybody backpedals. If this is to be the way the system works, we need to understand how our dollars combined (are captain planet!) can influence the system. If you are interested in taking part of this movement because you don't want SOPA/PIPA to pass, then feel free to take part.  
  
I doubt this campaign will affect any jobs, but if it does, not my problem. I am doing what is best for me. That is how America works now. If the cameramen are unhappy, they can unionize or strike, or just ask their bosses for a raise out of the obscene profits their bosses make. They should do what is best for them.  
  
Do I like this new democracy? Not a jot. I just think we all need to know how it works. Your vote means nothing. Your money means everything.  
  
For the several hundred people who simply posted ""not going to work"", I hope your solid contribution to the dialogue doesn't give you carpal tunnel syndrome. To everyone else, thanks for plosting, I hope you joined the subreddit, and have a happy spring festival! Have some Chinese food, and remember to wish the waiter or waitress Gong Xi Fa Cai!  
  
EditX: JOBS!!!! AAAHHHH! Let me tell you, this argument is always used by the rich to make it seem like their actions are selfless. How can we stop mining asbestos? Think of the jobs! Stop logging old growth forest? What about the jobs!!!!  How can we stop paying people to beat you about the head and neck? How will they feed their families?  
  
Edit(final): All those who say there are not enough of us, or that Hollywood won't notice, let me just say this: Reddit is one of the biggest mouthpieces for driving opinion on the net, and the net is where the world meets now. We are the cool kids. Every studio is scrambling for comic book IP so they can show that they are ""down with the nerds"" and it is sickening how successful they have been. Boycott, change your FB status, twitter it, tell your parents! As Gandhi said, ""be the change you want to see in the world"" (also ""fuck bitches, get democracy"")."
601,movies,Just saw Man of Steel [spoiler free],"Holy shit.

This movie completely blew me away. The cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack is glorious, and the fight scenes are the best I've ever seen in a super hero movie. They even manage to captures one truly tender moments between Clark and his parents. 

Zack Snyder has a brilliant imagination and it really comes through in this movie without over powering the subject matter. There is a primal current flowing through this movie that comes to a head in a scene filled with victory, and fear.

The cast and crew really knocked it out of the park on this one. I had Pacific Rin pegged as my summer movie but now I'm not sure if Man of Steel can be topped.

**EDIT**: first real movie review written for the public, definitely the most traffic I've gotten for a review. I've learned a lot from the experience. For instance: don't review from your phone when you are still hyped from the movie. Let it simmer a little. I still think MoS is the best movie of the summer and that it's my favorite Super Hero movie to date. I still think the story was great, if not deep it's satisfactory. But next time I will try to keep my hype in check, regardless of my love or hate for the film. Basically, keep it professional. So thank you to all for helping me become a better reviewer."
603,movies,"Dear Dan Aykroyd: If you must make a Ghostbusters sequel but can't get Bill Murray to play Venkman, please please please write his character out instead of recasting him.","Seriously. Bull Murray is Peter Venkman. No one else will do. If Ray Stantz is old with bad eyes bad knees and bad hips, now unable to be a Ghostbuster, why can't Venkman be dead? Or living on the moon? *Anything* but recasting that iconic character.

Just my $.02

(edit) [Aykroyd Suggests that Peter Venkman may be Recast](http://www.screened.com/news/dan-aykroyd-suggests-that-peter-venkman-may-be-recast-in-ghostbusters-3/3444/).
Wow! Front page!"
615,movies,"""Dredd"" is out on DVD/BluRay today. PLEASE support this under appreciated movie! ","For all intents and purposes Dredd should have been a sleeper hit. It was a great example of how to do a bad ass action movie on a light budget. Got a lot if positive buzz leading up to releases, but tripped at the goal line. Why? Poor marketing and being associated with the laughable Stallone movie probably had a lot to do with it. The producers said they'd make a sequel if it hit the $50 million mark, which a lot of big films do easy in their first weekend. But it fell well short of that, unfortunately. 

This movie deserves support from us. So whether its DVD, BluRay, Digital, give this one a chance. "
685,movies,Movies that you didn't think were going to be good but then blew you out of the water.,"List the movie you thought wasn't going to be any good but then were blown out of the water after seeing it, also list why it was so good. Avoid any movie where your response would be, ""my expectations were really low so I was surprised to see that it wasn't that bad"". 

The two movies that I would list are: **Cabin In The Woods** - It was released this year and is probably the best movie released along with the Avengers, when my friend asked me to go see it I was like ""great a stupid slasher film, whatever it's $5 tuesday"". Wow it was amazing hilarious and terrifying all at the same time and followed no cliches by including every cliche. The other movie I'd list is **Kick-Ass**, the trailers I saw on TV made it look terriblely unfunny, bad action and just crap all the way around, but when I watched it I realized it's probably one of the best superhero movies ever made. It has surprising moments, fantastic action, one of the best soundtracks and is comedic and dramatic at the right times.

**Edit 3:41 PM Eastern:** I wasn't expecting this link to be so popular I just wanted to hear about a few movies I don't know about that made an impression on people. I will update this at the top once I'm off work to include the popular titles listed so people can refer to this page for movies they may want to check out."
707,movies,"I believe all movie theaters should have a rule somewhere along the lines of ""after 7pm, no one under the age of 5 will be allowed in""","It becomes increasingly irritating every time I want to enjoy a movie, that I paid $10 for, to be ruined by small children who don't know better not to make noises. I understand that a kids will be kids and make noises. They simply have too small of an attention span for a movie, for which blame falls on the parents for bringing them to the theater. But why should we be punished for their inconsideration? All I want is to enjoy a movie in a quiet theater, and I don't think that's too much to ask. "
715,movies,"Would anyone else love to see another film set in 
'The Fifth Element' universe?","No idea what It would be about, but it would be awesome to see the style of the first film with today's special effects. Chris Tucker could do with the money as well.  
Edit: I mentioned it below in the comments, but I was thinking maybe a sequel where 
Mr Shadow creates an evil version of Leloo, maybe called the 'Sixth Element'. Black bandage outfit and all. 
The Light vs the Dark in some big ass superpowered fight. Super Green!  
Edit 2: woo hoo, first front page post.   
I think a lot of people have lost faith in Hollywood with all the crappy Reboots, Sequels and prequels that have polluted our screens this last decade and I can't really blame them.    
I think if Luc Besson, Jean Paul Gaultier, Bruce, Milla and Chris Tucker returned and the story was good, it could be an amazing film. Korben, Leloo and maybe their hybrid teenage child (suggested by someone in the comments) could be a family special forces squad, a bit like a Mass Effect squad going after whatever baddy they can think of (I still like my Dark version of Leloo, the Sixth or Dark Element.  
Edit 3: Well this has really divided a lot of redditors. 5000 downvotes and still on the front page, that's great. It's great to know there's so many lovers of the film out there in the Reddiverse. I wonder if Edgar Wright could do something good with a sequel? I'm loving reading all the comments.  
Edit 4: Still loving the suggestions the fun imaginative redditors are coming up with. I realise how poo mine are, but I'm really enjoying your guys ideas. I'd love to see a fan fiction made out of them.
"
735,movies,"13 fu#*ing minutes. 13 Goddamn fu#*ing minutes.
Or how trying to watch a DVD last night gave me my New Years resolution.","So my wife and I finally got around to watching ""Inception"" last night and right after that FBI warning telling us not to pirate movies, we were subjected to 13 fucking minutes of goddamn intolerable previews that we could NOT fast-forward through or skip by going to the menu. Now I'm sure that there's a hack for the FF/skipping (I tried stop, stop, play), and I'll try to figure that out later, but right now, that's not the fucking point. 13 goddamn minutes of my life is the fucking point.

13 minutes of previews. And not just movie previews (fucking owls, how do they work?), but a goddamn dumbass Harry Potter video game advert, and get this, a movie industry advert that is supposed to make me feel all warm and fucking fuzzy about watching movies, which dumb ass, we were already trying to watch, but were getting less and less inclined to do so because, in case I didn't say this before, there were 13 minutes of fucking shit that we couldn't fast-forward through before we could watch your goddamn movie that we fucking paid for.

So my New Years resolution? That this movie, with 13 fucking minutes of non-fast-forwardable/skippable previews, will be the last fucking movie I pay a goddamn dime for this year. Why? Because if I pirate a movie, I don't have to watch 13 fucking minutes of previews you ass wipes.

I, a non-techy, heretofore non-bit torrenter, non-pirater, am going to do a trade with my techy, IT friend and he will teach me how to download movies. And if he can fucking teach me to download a car, I'll motherfucking download that too. I'll become the motherfucking posterchild of pirating. Why you cry? Because of 13 fucking minutes of goddamn previews you soulless, MPAA motherfucking fucking fuckers fucking fucks!"
801,movies,"The Underrated, Homaged list of Pretentiously Foreshadowed Plotholes - a list of words that /r/movies always gets wrong.","**Underrated**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Any movie that they don't constantly hear about on reddit, the media, or from their friends.

**What it actually means:** a movie that wasn't critically well-received, that you think deserves higher praise.

Examples: We've all seen them. Every week someone calls Dredd ""underrated"" or some Oscar-nominated actor ""underrated."" It borders on self-parody at this point.

----------------------

**Homage**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Any time that Tarantino (whom I love) steals an idea from another movie. But only Tarantino, anyone else is a ""thief"" who rips off other ideas. For proof of this, just recall how many times you've heard that Avatar is a Pocahontas ripoff and how [Tarantino pays homage to every movie he takes from.](http://vimeo.com/19469447)

**What it actually means:** A deliberate nod to another piece of work, showing respect for it.

Examples of real homages: 

The [staircase scene in *The Untouchables*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-3DKkIv9S8) referencing the massively famous [*Battleship Potemkin* ""Odessa steps"" sequence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps-v-kZzfec). It should be noted that Brian de Palma walks the same fine line as Tarantino in terms of ""is he stealing, or making a homage?"" since some of his movies are nearly direct knock-offs of other movies, like [Blow Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082085/?ref_=sr_1) to [Blow-up.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060176/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Not ironically, de Palma is a favorite of Tarantino's, as well as Goddard, who also openly admitted to stealing from other works.

Charlize Theron walking on water in *Arrested Development*, [a nod to the ending of](/s ""Being There"") - [Link](http://youtu.be/Bow1ZJTV4L4?t=3m56s)

John Wayne [grabbing his elbow in *The Searchers*](http://youtu.be/GXUz-Nntyks?t=47s), a [tribute to Harry Carey](http://youtu.be/e0klfBXd5Jc?t=3m47s). This shot is also mirrored in Kill Bill 2, without the elbow grab.

Homages are typically *obvious* to the audience, because that's the point. It's not merely copying something, like nearly everyone suggests, it's making an overt gesture to tell fans how much you respect another piece of work.

Tarantino says that he [steals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LYT4JC2dd4), just like one of his major influences Goddard. He doesn't say he ""pays homage"" to anyone, as many of his fans like to argue. He wasn't *paying homage* to [City on Fire when he directly lifted large parts of the plot in Reservoir Dogs.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HgbSAL8OKY)

Another [one, just for fun.](http://youtu.be/7ZKgptV4GmQ?t=1m2s)

-------------------------------------

**Pretentious**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means:**

- Anyone who uses big words

- Anyone who speaks with a condescending tone

- Movies that are enigmatic

Examples of movies that are often called ""pretentious"" by /r/movies: The Master, Tree of Life, Brokeback Mountain, Crash

**What it actually means:** when art tries to be showier and deeper than it actually is, or when a person self-aggrandizes beyond their actual merit. 

Subjective Examples: Terrence Malick (whom I also love) is often criticized as pretentious. Why? Because in a lot of movies he has whispering voice over deliberately stating how characters feel, not giving the audience a chance to learn and feel with the characters. He skipped a step and went straight to the punchline. On the other end of the spectrum, overly-dramatic scenes in Transformers can also be called pretentious, when we're all-of-a-sudden supposed to care about two characters because the music changed and the sun is setting *just so* behind Megan Fox as she tries to hold on to Shia LeBoof's hand. Transporter also did this, constantly switching music to try its best at making us feel something for the characters. Man on Fire did this same technique with more success, prob due to just better filmmaking, acting, story, and characters. Wong Kar Wai's *Happy Together* was critically successful uses the same (years earlier) technique of constantly changing film stock and self-conscious cinematography, but due to the authentic drama of that film it'd be foolish to call it ""pretentious.""

Whatever *is* pretentious is obviously subjective, however the word's definition is being watered down everyday here by being thrown out every time  someone feels insecure about ""not getting"" a movie. It's fine to not get movies, btw. I've never understood the praise for plenty of classics.

---------------------

**Foreshadowing**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Any conceptual link between an event earlier in a movie to what occurs later in the movie. I often describe it as ""the astrology of film theory"" because so many people want to believe that [every little nuanced thing in films is part of some larger grand scheme](http://www.room237movie.com/about/). Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and [accidents do sometimes happen in films.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12vdtv/loop_lines_what_they_are_how_to_spot_them_and/)

Examples:  [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/19382h/noticed_some_foreshadowing_on_einhorns_desk_while/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/14plo4/possible_foreshadowing_in_skyfall_spoilers/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/178wwx/spoiler_cant_believe_i_never_noticed_the/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sw6s7/maybe_im_late_but_i_just_noticed_and_love_the/), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/p4nqm/my_favourite_lineforeshadowing_in_the_shawshank/)

**What it actually means**: Foreshadowing is a direct hint to the audience about what direction the movie will go in. Foreshadowing must nudge you. Going back and noticing the misty breath in The Sixth Sense isn't foreshadowing, because the film never hints that that meant something. Clues aren't the same thing. And if they are, then we need a *new word* for the *old definition* of foreshadowing.

A good explanation from [/u/Clumpy](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dt0it/defining_foreshadowing/c9tl12d) - ""At its most basic level, foreshadowing is authorial and sort of a bending if not breaking of the fourth wall. ... **Giving undue emphasis** to some peripheral element of the story or world only to have it come back into the story in a big way is another common example.
... Shows like Lost really relied on this audience tendency to create depth whether it was actually there, and the tendency still seems particularly bad in ongoing narrative-based television shows. But **a character eating a sandwich in one scene and then getting hit by a food delivery truck at the end of the movie isn't foreshadowing**.""

Examples:

Evil music behind a character's entrance is foreshadowing. Someone entering via shadow hints at their motivations.

Foreshadowing can be dialogue ""You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain"" begs us to apply it to the whole story. It can be repetition - seeing oranges around death in The Godfather gives us a pattern. Or it can be semiotics - The box of ""Ka-Boom"" cereal in Kill Bill is pretty distracting - ""why'd they name it Ka-Boom?"" it suggests.

The level of emphasis remains subjective, but an overt hint is much different than just conceptual similarities. Most of the examples I provided earlier are considered [""motif.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_\(narrative\))

Here's a [student video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJdXA6zNgqU) examining more excellent core examples of foreshadowing, emphasis on it being a *narrative technique that helps move the story along*, not *cool puzzles for the audience to figure out*.


-------------------------

**Plot Holes**
-

This one might just be lost to the masses since it's so overly misused these days. If that's the case, we need a *new term* for the *old definition* of the phrase.

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Anything unexplained, literally ""holes in the plot,"" or things someone didn't understand.

**What it actually means**: When a movie betrays its own logic.

A great explanation is [here](http://badassdigest.com/2012/10/30/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulk-vs.-plot-holes-and-movie-logic/), with highlights:

LET'S BE CLEAR - A PLOT HOLE IS NOT ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:

A) SOMETHING THAT ONLY SEEMS CONFUSING IN RETROSPECT

B) AN EVENT THAT OCCURS OFF-SCREEN

C) A LOOSE END (THOUGH IT CAN BE)

D) SOMETHING BASED ON AN UNRESEARCHED HISTORICAL ASSUMPTION

E) SOMETHING BASED ON OVER-RESEARCHED HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE

AND F) CONTINUITY ERRORS + PEOPLE JUST PLAIN NOT WATCHING MOVIES AND MISSING INFORMATION

Examples of actual plot holes: From the above article/referencing [this article](http://badassdigest.com/2011/05/05/best-movies-ever-jurassic-park-1993/) regarding Jurassic Park:

""What’s most incredible, for me, is the way the scene works completely on its own terms despite making no real world sense. How did the trams end up back at the T-Rex paddock? How did the T-Rex eat the goat and climb up on the road when it is established after this scene that there’s a hundred foot drop on the other side of the wall? Sometimes movie making is magic, and sleight of hand is a magician’s best friend; Spielberg is such a master that even when you’re looking out for these geographical bloopers they barely register.""

Another plothole: At the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the movie tells us that anyone will fall through the hop-scotch stone tiles if they don't step on the correct letters, in order. Jones steps on the wrong letter, falls through, but [*grabs on and pulls himself up from another wrong letter tile.*](http://youtu.be/9iDeE3mKVfs?t=38s)

------------------------------

Hope some of this helps! If you have any questions, want to offer more examples, or challenge any of these concepts, it's all welcome!

Another post Oscars discussion thread will be up a little bit after the Oscars are over.

If you're looking for more, less circlejerky discussion I suggest trying either /r/flicks or /r/truefilm. 

"
866,movies,I just watched Spirited Away. It was fucking incredible.,"It was one of the most emotionally gripping movies I think I've ever watched! I know it came out a while ago, but I finally got around to watching it. I can't get over how incredible it was! The adorable little animals! The monsters! The struggle! It was all so great! Ahhh!

Are there any other movies like this one?! Any TV shows?! I'm freaking the fuck out!

**TL;DR - Losing my shit over Spirited Away. Any other shows like that? Go watch it if you haven't.**"
890,movies,Did anyone else actually enjoy John Carter?,"I've heard nothing but bad things on the interwebs about this film. 

Personally I really enjoyed the film. Despite some obvious flaw with any big budget blockbuster the film was solid and visually stunning. 

Was John Carter a victim of harsh critics? or did the lack of advertising (in the UK atleast) kill it? 

EDIT: alot of people seem to hate The casting of Taylor Kitsch as John Carter. If given the chance who would you cast instead?

Thoughts?"
895,movies,"The Good, The Bad, The Weird. A Korean western on Netflix Instant that I think Redditors would dig.","While not going to top any great films list, this movie was a surprisingly good time with some great action scenes, outlandish but fun aesthetics, and great protagonist. Although it mimics the story of Sergio Leone's classic, the film never takes itself seriously and that's the best part about it. I can imagine fans of Tarantino really enjoying this film. "
903,movies,"Testing Interest: IamA Cinematographer on The Dark Knight Rises, as well as most of Chris Nolan's movies","I want to test out interest, I directly know the man who shot this summer's Dark Knight Rises, as well as most of Nolan's other movies. He is currently set to make a directorial debut with ""Untitled Wally Pfister Project"" through Alcon entertainment.

Testing the waters, any interest for an AMA? Will ask him if there is enough attention.


EDIT: Thought I would test in r/movies beforehand, I know this isn't r/iama"
914,movies,Confirmed: Jim Carrey to play the role of The Colonel in Kick-Ass II,http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a403376/jim-carrey-confirmed-for-kick-ass-2-by-director-jeff-wadlow.html
921,movies,Pacific Rim has done amazing overseas; grossing over 178 million worldwide after its second weekend. And it still hasn't opened in China and Japan yet.,"Stats can be seen here:

http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pacificrim.htm"
922,movies,The problem with Gone with the Wind being the highest grossing movie of all time...,"Gone with the Wind is the highest grossing movie of all time. Adjusted for inflation it has made 3.3 billion dollars. Does this sound familiar? Whenever people bring up big summer movies that make a ton of cash there is always someone who throws this out there and to them I say... that's awesome, but let's put that into context. All $ from here on out has been adjusted for inflation.  
   
Gone with the Wind was released in 1939 and its initial run lasted until 1943. It made 221 million its first year in limited release and then 285 million over its next 3 years in general release to bring its initial 4 year total to 506 million globally. Combining those 4 years it sold 60 million tickets. So over four years it sold 60 million tickets and made $506 million in the US. Let's compare that to Iron Man 3 that sold roughly 40 million tickets and made 380 million in its first four weeks in the US or The Avengers that sold 50 million and made 532 million and all of a sudden Gone with the Wind isn't looking all that impressive. So where did the rest of Gone with the Wind's gross come from? That would be the eight re-releases in 1947, 1954, 1961, 1967, 1971, 1974, 1989, and 1998 which earned the movie its additional 2.8 billion dollars.  
   
So the next time someone throws out how much money Gone with the Wind made keep it mind it took the movie nearly 60 years to reach it’s total. Many of those years took place during a time when alternative entertainment was not as easily accessible as it is today. There was no TV for the first 10 years of the movies run, no movie rentals for the first 40 years, there certainly wasn't Netflix, video games, sports packages, computers, and whatever other endless river of entertainment options we have today.  
   
TLDR – Gone with the Wind made 506 million in its first 4 years and had 8 other re-releases over the span of 60 years to bring its total to 3.3 billion.

If this doesn't matter to you please feel free to respond with whatever colorful variation of, ""Frankly geekRAT, I just don't give a damn!"" that you would like.  
   
edit* - Some kind redditors pointed out that the 4 year total for GwtW was for the US only so I changed it to reflect that for both movies, I also added The Avenger because it better illustrates my point. Switched need to had in the TLDR because GwtW didn't NEED anything. Fixed the wiki link to actually work. /patchnotes

968,movies,Has your Netflix Instant signal quality been sucking recently? Here's why that might be...,"In the last month I've been having issues with my netflix app on my 360 maintaining more than 1 or 2 bars, and HD popping on and off. I've never had any issues with this before, so I called my ISP out to check my connection. They said it was fine. I also noticed that on the same console, the Amazon Prime and HBO go HD streams worked perfectly. Full bars, always on HD.

At this point I assumed it was a Netflix error, so I called their customer support. At first the ""tech"" woman I spoke with said it was my connection speed not being fast enough. I explained to her that I had 30 megs down (Time Warner Cable Austin's fastest residential option), and it was just checked and working properly (not to mention all other HD streaming services were working fine). She contacted a supervisor and came back and said the supervisor said the ISP was throttling Netflix.

At this point I asked to speak to the supervisor because I didn't want to go back to Reddit and accuse my ISP of throttling without some more facts.

Here is what the supervisor ""William"" at the Netflix location in Denver told me.

1. Netflix just released (a month ago, when I started having issues) what they're internally calling ""super HD"" or a true 1080p stream for their HD instant content.

2. They are having issues with ISPs throttling this stream because it's not really a stream. With the 1080p content, they are downloading large data packets instead of smaller 1080i/720p streams. This is sending red flags to ISPs to throttle.

3. The reason Amazon Prime and HBO GO is still working is because they're not requesting as much data.

4. They're having less issues with Instant Netflix streaming on PC because it's based on Silverlight, and this is mainly an issue with apps on consoles like the 360 or PS3.

I asked him if there was anything I could do. He said I could suspend my account with Netflix until the ""heartburn period"" was over with this 1080p upgrade to their streams. He said they're in constant talks with the ISPs to resolve the issue, but the ISPs are upset because of peer connection issues with Netflix, and Netflix not allowing it.

So, just a heads up if anyone is experiencing HD streaming issues with NETFLIX and their console apps.


Edit Update: 'NfNitloop' in comments below pointed to this article which explains things a bit more. Seems like TWC and NetFlix are butting heads over how to supply this new ""SuperHD"" while we sit around with substandard service. http://m.cnet.com/news/time-warner-cable-netflix-at-odds-over-super-hd-3d/57564467

Saved by my thumbnail and my two faithful ranch dogs, I hiked out of a box canyon and drove myself four miles down a rutted logging road to our little rural fire station from which I was airlifted to UCLA Medical Center. There I underwent eight hours of emergency surgery and survived the subsequent onslaught of LA reality television's media hounds.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYM8xTQt3Bg) is an introductory video to what I hope will be a great AMA.

My name is [Chris Hadfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hadfield), and I am an astronaut for the Canadian Space Agency and Commander of the upcoming mission to the International Space Station. We will be launching at 6:12 p.m. Kazakh time on December 19th. You can watch it online [here](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html) if you're so inclined.

I'm looking forward to all the questions. I will be in class doing launch prep. for the next hour, but thought I would start the thread early so people can get their questions in before the official 11:00 EST launch.

I try to keep up to date with all comments and questions that go through  the social media sites, so if I can't get to your question here, please don't hesitate to post it there.

Ask away!

Edit: Thanks for all the questions everyone! It is getting late here, so I am going to answer a few more and wrap it up. I greatly appreciate all the interest reddit has shown, and hope that you'll all log on and watch the launch on the 19th. Please be sure to follow my twitter or facebook if you have any more questions or comments you'd like to pass along in the future. Good night!"

20,IAmA,You’re probably connecting to reddit through a technology I invented. I’m Bob Metcalfe and I invented Ethernet – AMA,"On May 22, 1973 with David R. Boggs, I used my IBM Selectric with its Orator ball to type up a memo to my bosses at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), outlining our idea for this little invention called “Ethernet”, which we later patented.

I worked with the IEEE Standards Association to develop the IEEE 802.3 standard for Ethernet, which specifies the physical and lower software layers. Today Ethernet and the IEEE 802.3 standard are the foundation for today’s world of high-speed communications used in billions of homes and businesses around the world.

I submitted [this](http://imgur.com/BDGYoKW) to the mods awhile back so I could get on the calendar but I figured you’d like to see it, too. Now, ask me anything!

21,IAmA,"I am Peter Moore, the longest held hostage in Iraq, kept captive for over 2.5 years. AMA","In April of 2007 I accepted a three month posting in Iraq working for the American IT consulting firm BearingPoint.
 
I arrived in Baghdad on the 2nd of April 2007 where my main job was to develop spending reports from the computer system used within the Ministry of Finance. 

On the 29th of May, 2007 around one hundred Iraqi police officers from the Ministry of Interior entered the building and took away myself and four British guards. 
 
For six months I was moved around meeting up with the British guards. In December of 2007 I was separated from the other Britons and was held with two Americans. In June of 2007 I was transported back to Baghdad and this was the last time I had contact with any of the other hostages.
 
In May of 2009 the number two commander of the militia (Laith Al Khazlli) was released from US custody in exchange for the bodies of two of the British guards. In September over one hundred militia were released in exchange for the body of one of the guards.
 
On the 30th of December 2009, 946 days (or 2 years, 7 months &amp; 1 day) after I was captured, I was released in exchange for the militia leader Qais Al Khazlli. The last of the hostages bodies were eventually handed over in early 2012.

36,IAmA,We are two men who spent 42 years in prison for crimes we did not commit. AMA (Ask us anything),"We are Clarence Harrison and Robert Clark. With the help of the Georgia Innocence Project (GIP) and DNA testing, we were exonerated from prison after spending 18 years and 24 years, respectively, in prison for crimes we didn’t commit. 

We are answering questions today. An intern at GIP is helping us type our answers. 

Clarence Harrison:
Clarence was convicted in 1987 for rape, robbery, and kidnapping in Decatur, Georgia. Clarence was interrogated about a rape, solely based on rumor. The victim positively identified him in a photo lineup, later proven to be mistaken identification. He was exonerated after GIP found a slide from the original rape kit and performed DNA testing that confirmed that Clarence was not the perpetrator. He was the first man exonerated by GIP and was exonerated in 2004 after serving nearly 18 years in prison. 

Robert Clark: 
Robert was convicted of rape, kidnapping, and armed robbery in 1982. The victim positively identified him in a photo lineup and in the courtroom, even though the actual perpetrator was in the courtroom at the same time. (Robert is 5 or 6 inches taller than the real perpetrator). DNA testing proved that Robert could not be the perpetrator; the DNA matched a man already in prison serving time for sodomy and cruelty to children. Robert was 21 years old when he went to prison and spent 24 years wrongfully incarcerated, more than half of his life.

We will post a picture of them at the computer as soon as they arrive and begin answering questions. 
Also, edit for more information on wrongful convictions.

EDIT #2: They are here! We're super sorry but we are going to be answering questions as quickly as possible! Posting picture as proof ASAP!

Clarence is sticking around though!!!!!

EDIT #5: Clarence is finishing up. His parting words:
""It has been very fun and I appreciate you all being so interested in what it has been like for an innocent man to have been falsely imprisoned. I have to say this technology stuff has really gone a long way. I would have never believed that you could have so much fun with people and not even be able to see them. And I look forward to this adventure in the future, and it truly was an adventure due to the fact that I STILL do not know what we are doing.""

38,IAmA,I created Imgur. AMA.,"I came across [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/y65jo/four_years_ago_a_redditor_lets_the_guy_who_made/) yesterday and there seems to be some confusion out there about imgur, as well as some people asking for an AMA. So here it is! Sometimes you get what you ask for and [sometimes you don't](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/y2z5f/after_sending_imgur_an_email_in_a_notsosober/).

*I'll start with some background info:* I created Imgur while I was a junior in college (Ohio University) and [released it to you guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting). It took a while to monetize it, and it actually ran off of [your donations](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9nsoa/mrgrim_creator_of_imgur_is_barely_breaking_even/) for about the first 6 months. Soon after that, the bandwidth bills were starting to overshadow the donations that were coming in, so I had to put some ads on the site to help out. Imgur accounts and pro accounts came in about another [6 months after that](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ank6i/reddit_ive_been_promising_this_to_you_for_months/). At this point I was still in school, working part-time at minimum wage, and the site was breaking even. It turned out that OU had some pretty awesome resources for startups like Imgur, and I got connected to a guy named Matt who worked at the Innovation Center on campus. He gave me some business help and actually got me a small one-desk office in the building. Graduation came and I was working on Imgur full time, and Matt and I were working really closely together. In a few months he had joined full-time as COO. Everything was going really well, and about another 6 months later we moved Imgur out to San Francisco. Soon after we were here Imgur won [Best Bootstrapped Startup](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/imgur-wins-best-bootstrapped-startup-sees-1-billion-pageviews-per-month/) of 2011 according to TechCrunch. [Then we started hiring](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/02/02/were-hiring/) more people. The first position was Director of Communications (Sarah), and then a few months later we hired [Josh](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/03/23/imgur-is-growing/) as a Frontend Engineer, then [Jim](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/04/18/welcome-to-imgur-jim/) as a JavaScript Engineer, and then finally [Brian and Tony](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/07/10/welcome-brian-and-tony/) as Frontend Engineer and Head of User Experience. That brings us to the present time. Imgur is still ad supported with a little bit of income from pro accounts, and is able to support the bandwidth cost from only advertisements.

*Some problems we're having right now:*

* Scaling the site has always been a challenge, but we're starting to get really good at it. There's layers and layers of caching and failover servers, and the site has been really stable and fast the past few weeks. Maintenance and running around with our hair on fire is quickly becoming a thing of the past. I used to get alerts randomly in the middle of the night about a database crash or something, which made night life extremely difficult, but this hasn't happened in a long time and I sleep much better now.

* Matt has been really awesome at getting quality advertisers, but since Imgur is a user generated content site, advertisers are always a little hesitant to work with us because their ad could theoretically turn up next to porn. In order to help with this we're working with some companies to help sort the content into categories and only advertise on images that are brand safe. That's why you've probably been seeing a lot of Imgur ads for pro accounts next to NSFW content.

* For some reason Facebook likes matter to people. With all of our pageviews and unique visitors, we only have 35k ""likes"", and people don't take Imgur seriously because of it. It's ridiculous, but that's the world we live in now. I hate shoving likes down people's throats, so Imgur will remain very non-obtrusive with stuff like this, even if it hurts us a little. However, it would be pretty awesome if you could help: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Imgur/67691197470

Along with my husband, Rick Hall, I also teach song improv (like we do on Whose Line), and have created a cd set called ""Improv Karaoke"", to help people learn how to do it.  Sure it's scary, but its also tons of fun.

Okay, enough plugging.  While I'm happy to talk about our Sundance-winning, beloved-by-audiences-everywhere comedy feature movie film, I'd be even more happy to talk about something else.  Radio, dogs, the relative heights and weights and body fat counts of various public radio personalities, the work of Michael Lewis, the possibility of a This American Life musical, the cinema event we did last May, David Rakoff, how are we supposed to feel about Andrew Sullivan this week, the merits of shotgun vs omni microphones.

Redditors [helped suggest] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kltha/hey_reddit_help_ken_jennings_write_his_next_book/) about thirty of the myths in the book, and I mailed them free copies last week as promised.  

Here are some [SHOCKING VIDEOS] (http://youtube.com/becauseisaidsobook) we made about how the book was written.  Please check out the book if it sounds funny to you.  It has GREAT HOLIDAY GIFT written all over it.  (Not literally.)

This AMA might not be as good as [the last one] (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fwpzj/iama_74time_jeopardy_champion_ken_jennings_i_will/) because I can't use any of the same jokes.  Sorry in advance.

**Edited to add:** Okay, guys and gals, I have to run, I have a book signing tonight.  Also, we just got knocked off the top of the front page by a homophobic milk carton. :(  Sorry if I didn't get to your question, but I answered as many as I could.  My parents always taught me: ""With great power comes great response ability.""

If you have enjoyed our time here together, please consider checking out [Because I Said So!] (http://books.simonandschuster.net/buy/Because-I-Said-So!/9781451656251/from-other-retailers) which is also me answering questions in smart-ass ways.  Plus if its sales rank skyrockets after I do this, think of all the clout that Reddit will have in the publishing world.  The Joyce Carol Oates AMA will be inevitable.

You can also see me regularly in [Parade magazine](http://parade.com/kennections), [Slate.com](http://www.slate.com/authors.ken_jennings.html), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KenJennings), and places like that.  Until next time, Reddit!"

70,IAmA,"Hey mods, you know what would be cool? A tag that shows if an AMA is currently happening or already complete.","I don't know how else to submit it, but it'd be sweet if after the AMA is over (and a lot of them like Krugman, Harleson, Ringwald are short run kind of things) there was a tag that would show the person isn't taking questions anymore. Kind of like the schedule has, but on the actual post so it appears on the front page.

Edit: So, I think what they need is a bot that can add and remove tags. When the AMA starts, it's ""Active."" The bot monitors how often the person posts replies on the thread, and it stays ""Active"" while they're meeting a certain threshold. If their threshold drops, it changes to ""Slowing down."" If they haven't posted for a while, it switches to ""Inactive."" This would automate what we can't realistically expect the mods to do, and has the added benefit of changing old AMA's back to active if they start getting responses again. "

I make films and we can talk about that if you like, but I’m also on the board of directors of a new organization called [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org). My fellow board members include legendary whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, writers Glenn Greenwald and Xeni Jardin, award-winning documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow.

We all came together in December to try to start a broad movement to help protect and defend the First Amendment, given secrecy is at an all time high and whistleblowers have never been under greater attack. I wrote about it for [Huffington Post here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cusack/why-im-donating-to-fund-t_b_2632389.html).  You can also read the two talks I did with leading free speech law professor Jonathan Turley and Kevin McCabe [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cusack/what-is-an-assange_b_2317824.html) and [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cusack/what-is-an-assange-part-2_b_2402236.html).  

Back in 2010, WikiLeaks was cut-off from payment processors despite committing no crime, after unofficial pressure from a couple Congressman. We wanted to make sure that doesn’t happen to another journalism organization again, but we also wanted to help other organizations bring transparency to government.

So, we’re taking donations to WikiLeaks, but also supporting three other innovative organizations, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Truthout, and Public Integrity.

They each have a specific secrecy-busting project on US drone strikes, the Guantanamo trials, and US defense spending that your money will fund. And every two months, we're going to support a new bundle of organizations similar to these. You can go to our website and donate to any or all of these organizations here: https://pressfreedomfoundation.org

So hopefully you donate. But whether or not you do, spread the word around and read and support these organizations that are doing such important work. Obviously everyone can't afford to donate, but awareness and knowledge is just as important.

Ask me anything though.

Recently, through TED Books, I co-authored *The Demise of Guys: Why Boys Are Struggling and What We Can Do About It*.  My book questions whether the rampant **overuse** of video games and porn are damaging this generation of men. 
 
Based on survey responses from 20,000 men, dozens of individual interviews and a raft of studies, my co-author, Nikita Duncan, and I propose that the excessive use of videogames and online porn is creating a generation of shy and risk-adverse guys suffering from an “arousal addiction” that cripples their ability to navigate the complexities and risks inherent to real-life relationships, school and employment.

99,IAmA,We are SpaceX Software Engineers - We Launch Rockets into Space - AMA,"**We are software engineers at SpaceX.  We work on:**

* Code that goes on rockets and spacecraft.
* Code that supports the design and manufacturing process of rockets and spacecraft.

We work on everything from large-scale web applications to tiny embedded computing platforms.  We build tech stacks on C#/MVC4/EF/MSSQL via REST to Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS, C++/Embedded Linux, Python, LabVIEW… which all together enables us to build, launch, and monitor stuff that goes to space.


**Some videos of our recent work:**

http://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ



**Proof:**

http://imgur.com/bl8dlZ2

Edit: Poor Dan, everyone knows he was photo-shopped. Don't close your eyes next time! 

Edit 2 : We've been getting a lot of questions about how C#/MVC/etc have to do with rockets. They don't. At SpaceX we have 4 separate software teams:

1.  The Flight Software team is about 35 people.  We write all the code for Falcon 9, Grasshopper, and Dragon applications; and do the core platform work, also on those vehicles; we also write simulation software; test the flight code; write the communications and analysis software, deployed in our ground stations.  We also work in Mission Control to support active missions.

2. The Enterprise Information Systems team builds the internal software systems that makes spacex run. We wear many hats, but the flagship product we develop and release is an internal web application that nearly every person in the company uses. This includes the people that are creating purchase orders and filling our part inventory, engineers creating designs and work orders with those parts, technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what today's work will be per those designs...and literally everything in between. There are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass! SpaceX is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one - which is critical to our success - and our team is on the forefront of making that happen. We leverage C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and a super sexy REST API.

3. The Ground Software team is about 9 people. We primarily code in LabVIEW.  We develop the GUIs used in Mission and Launch control, for engineers and operators to monitor vehicle telemetry and command the rocket, spacecraft, and pad support equipment.  We are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner.

4. The Avionics Test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing.  We catch problems with the hardware early; when it's time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit.  The main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume.  The software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests.

Edit 3: Yes, we are doing a ton of hiring for these software positions that we have been talking about today. Interns and New Grads too! 

Edit 4: Thank you so much everyone! This is ending but most of the group will be back at 2:00pmPST to answer more questions. 

Edit 5: ...and we're back! Engineers from each of our engineering teams are present. Let us catch up a bit and start swering again (probably be about 5 minutes).

For all open software related positions, please go to http://www.spacex.com/software.php

**Edit 6: Thank you so much Reddit! This was a ton of fun. To all those asking about internships and employment, our suggestion is to apply online. Your resume will definitely get read. To all the students out there, GL with your midterms coming up and stick at it. Try and work on some side projects and get as much practical experience coding as possible before graduating. Happy Friday everyone!**

103,IAmA,IAMA I'm Prince Michael of the Principality of Sealand. Est. 1967 we're the smallest Independent State in the world. Our tiny nation has seen confrontations with governments and I was kidnapped by armed terrorists.,"In 1966, I was 14, I left private school and moved with my father Roy Bates to an abandoned WW2 fortress in the North Sea and on Sept. 2, 1967, we declared the fortress to be the Principality of Sealand, an independent sovereign nation. My father declared himself Prince and my mother Princess.

Our claim was emboldened the next year when, after I faced weapons charges for firing warning shots at an approaching British vessel, a British court ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the case because the exchange had occurred in international waters.

A decade later, a greater drama ensued when a group of Germans with plans to build a luxury casino on the fortress tried to take control of Sealand while my mother and father were away. They held me hostage for several days before releasing me. A few days later myself, my dad and a few close Sealanders stormed Sealand and retook it in a dramatic armed helicopter raid, (the helicopter was piloted by our close friend John Crewdson, a James Bond stunt pilot!). Once the fort was retaken, we imprisoned the men there. When the German government sought Britain’s help in freeing them, Britain declined to intervene, citing the 1968 ruling. Germany sent a diplomat, the men were eventually freed, and My father Roy asserted that Germany had effectively recognized Sealand as a sovereign nation.

Sealand has its own flag, currency, passports, national anthem, stamps and most recently a national Football Team! 

There have also been recent meetings in Hollywood regarding the making of a Sealand film.

I am currently editing my book ready for publishers to see.

Hi Redditors!

I've always enjoyed doing Q&amp;A's on 4chan, and have gotten a lot of requests to do an AMA on Reddit over the years.

My background: I founded [4chan](http://www.4chan.org) in 2003, and have been working on a new site called [Canvas](http://canv.as), which launched two months ago in invite-only private beta.

**About Us**

We are lawyers, plaintiffs, and civil liberties advocates involved in the Hedges v. Obama lawsuit and other activism to fight the NDAA - specifically the ""indefinite detention"" provision.  

Indefinite detention was passed as part of the fiscal 2012 National Defense Authorization Act and signed into law by President Obama on New Years Eve last Decemb.  It would allow the military to detain civilians -- even Americans -- indefinitely and without charge or trial. 

The provision being fought (Section 1021 of the NDAA) suspends due process and seriously threatens First Amendment rights.  Judge Katherine Forrest ruled entirely in favor of the plaintiffs earlier this month, calling Section 1021 completely unconstitutional and granting a permanent injunction against its enforcement.  

The Obama DOJ has vigorously opposed these efforts, and immediately appealed her ruling and requested an emergency stay on the injunction - claiming the US would incur ""irreparable harm"" if the president lost the power to use Section 1021 - and detain anyone, anywhere ""until the end of hostilities"" on a whim.  This case will probably make its way to the Supreme Court.

They'll try to stop by later on and fill in any gaps, but see the links below for more info on how you can help and be sure to follow [@LibertyinNK](https://twitter.com/LibertyinNK) and [@aym](https://twitter.com/aym) for ongoing info about North Korea and digital human rights activism, respectively. Please share widely, and until the next time!

**Hey Folks,** [Movements.org](http://movements.org) here for this AMA. This is JJ at the keyboard and we are joined tonight (or this morning in a chilly Seoul) by an incredible organization [Liberty in North Korea: LiNK](http://libertyinnorthkorea.org/) who is sitting beside (and providing translation for) our friend Sang-hyun who recently escaped from North Korea. Because of the ongoing danger involved in making this passage and the constant threat of retribution, we are not using Sang-hyun's real name, and the best proof we can offer of his identity is a Tweet from both organizations here: [Movements.org](https://twitter.com/aym/status/304006187039485953) and [LINK](http://www.movements.org/page/-/Screen%20Shot%202013-02-19%20at%206.28.34%20PM.png). Over the next hour-and-a-half, Sang-hyun will be available to answer any question you have about North Korea-- our goal is to get past the headlines about nukes and sanctions that have bombarded us these past few weeks and understand a bit better what the **people** living inside the [most repressive regime in the world](http://libertyinnorthkorea.org/learn/nk-crisis/) are dealing with every day. 

We hope you'll forgive the intermediary nature of this AMA, but responses coming from Movements_Guest will be coming directly from LiNK and Sang-hyun himself.

**Movements.org** provides support to human rights activists using digital tools to fight repression and helps amplify those voices around the world who are calling for freedom. While we've done a number of activist chats on Twitter, this is our first Reddit AMA, and over the next few months we hope to bring you more opportunities to speak directly with those fighting on the front lines for basic human rights. For a bit more background on this AMA, and to Join Us, visit: [Movements.org](http://movements.org).

**Liberty in North Korea (LiNK)** is the only full-time grassroots organization in North America devoted to the North Korean human rights and humanitarian crises. LiNK provides protection and aid to North Korean refugees hiding in China and, utilizing a modern-day underground railroad through Southeast Asia, rescues refugees and helps them to reach freedom. LiNK’s global grassroots movement works to redefine public perception on North Korea, shifting attention away from the politics and onto the people, and provides a way for concerned citizens to come alongside the North Korean people and help bring about positive change. LiNK also works to develop people-focused strategies that will have the potential to promote change inside North Korea in the long term.

So without further ado, here we go...

*To this day I'm convinced that your appearance at the White House
Correspondents' Dinner was because the Bush Administration didn't understand
your show.*

*Did they? What happened behind the scenes there? Was it more ""non-alcoholic
beer in the Roosevelt Room"" or ""Dick Cheney peppering your limo with
bird-shot as you beat a hasty retreat?""*

I was as surprised as the next guy that I was invited to roast the
President and the press corps that spring.

Here's how it works. The White House Press Association (or some name close to
that) actually does the inviting, not the President or White House. The
president of the press association that year was a man named, I believe,
Mark Smith, I think from the AP. He invited me. When all was said and done, I wrote to thank him and said I hoped I hadn't
made trouble for him. He said there was zero fallout. 

As for the backstage
aspects of the night, the President has a nice, small gathering in a room
near the banquet hall. The presidential seal is etched into the granite on
the floor. A few news anchors, football greats, cabinet members and advisors
(I remember Rove and Chertoff, there were others I think), Rich Dahm,
Allison Silverman, my brothers and sisters and mom, my wife Evie, and the
President and Mrs. Bush.  Let me say that the President could not have been
nicer, especially to my mother. I have some lovely pictures of her with him.
The President and I had a brief conversation before we went on stage.  There
were in total maybe 60 people at the party, many of whom I should remember
more about, but I was pretty focused on my job that night.  There was no
backstage event after the dinner, but several parties around town.

I had my family up to our room for a drink then hit a party, don't remember
which one. We all had a great time. but I had no sense of public reaction
until Monday at work.

*You gained your fame and fortune slightly later in life, was there ever a
point in your career where you thought about plan B? What kept you going as
an actor, why did you keep trying?*

*At what point did you realize that everything was probably going to be okay,
was it a specific gig you landed?  What did you do to excel your career when
you weren't booking gigs? Lastly, do you have any advice for 20 somethings
pursuing a tough career during this economic downfall where it isn't just
actors who aren't getting jobs?*

When you are young and single, there really isnt anything to worry about.

Will you starve? Not likely. I worried that I didnt have enough gumption to
get work. That I wouldn't know how to network or something. But at a young
age several people, some professors and directors, told me I had talent, and
that it was mine to husband if I was willing to work.  Those kind words
sustained me, many times.

I mostly just said yes to any opportunity to get on stage. Pay or no pay.
Equity, amateur, comedy, avant garde, and improv especially. Chicago
has a great improv community, and I could get up on stage a lot after I
got to know the other members of the community. I called it getting in
trouble. You say yes to something, then you are in trouble. You have to
deliver.  Each mini-crisis I forced myself into made me work hard.

As for true doubt, it got under my skin deeply only once. I was
newly-married and I was offered a part I would have loved, but no pay. I had
worked for six years doing anything, but had made a deal with myself that if
I ever was to have family I could support, I would have to insist on pay. A
small rule, right? But hard for a young actor to keep. Mostly you don't
really get paid.

I said no to the part and immediately (I mean within minutes) went into a
spiral of panic that lasted for months. I was sure I had made the wrong
decision (I hadn't) and would never get a part like it again. But the worst
feeling was that I knew I truly wanted to be an actor and there was no
turning back now. I was too old to do anything else.  This was a feeling I
wouldn't wish on anyone.

Importantly, I was wrong on all counts. Just keep working as long as you
can't thnk of anything else you could happily do. Keep saying yes.

*After viewing the more candid interaction you had with John Kerry recently,
I'm curious:*

*How often are there times, on the show, or in your day to day life where
people will express a strong feeling of agreement with the more ludicrous
things you say? Do you ever just want to yell ""No you idiot, you can't
possibly agree with what I said. What I said was stupid, and you're stupid
for agreeing with me!""*

*I know I often play devil's advocate in arguments for fun, and sometimes I
have to stop half way and just say ""No, stop agreeing with me!""*

There have been many times that I have successfully argued a position I
don't agree with. That's a lot of fun.  But the sort of thing that gets me
is when simple lies are not refuted, like, ""The founding fathers were all
deeply-committed Christians who believed in the literal word of the Bible.""

""Tax increases on the rich are proven to lead to job losses.""

*Do you feel like the comedy news shows by you and Stewart are having any
effect on the actual mainstream / cable news networks?*

*You both pick their stories apart frequently and point out their biases,
have you noticed any change in their practices? Is the goal of your show
purely to entertain, or would you really like to affect a change on the news
media?*

I think the phrase ""purely to entertain"" has a nice ring to it. Much better than ""merely to entertain.""

I presently have no plans to change
the news media. They are changing themselves without any help from me.  I
seem to remember that when I started the show five years ago there were
fewer jokes in the cable news nightly broadcasts. And I was the only one
crying on a regular basis. I could be misremembering that.

\#5 by [Btrash](/user/Btrash)

*Who have you tried to get for an interview, but won't come on your show? Who
would you like to interview the most?*

I've never been heartbroken not to have a guest. Our game doesn't flourish
because of big names, but because of strong feelings about the guest
or passion from the guest on their subject. And my booker is tenacious.

That being said, I'd like to have more conservatives on.  But I can
understand guests' hesitancy. They don't always know what to expect
from a character. That may make them uncomfortable.

Salinger would have been nice. I'm a fan.

\#6 by [noncompliantcitizen](/user/noncompliantcitizen)

*Do you sometimes wish you could not be in character for some interviews?
Being in character, do you feel that it prevents some people from coming on
the show?*

Well these questions are really related. I'll say that from my end of
the interview, I often have a guest whose subject I happen to know a thing or
two about, and I want to engage them intelligently, but I am an aggressively
ignorant character. That is frustrating. Of course knowing their subject
lets me make the dumbest possible characterizations of their position or
idea. If you ever see me truly being vigorously dense with a guest, I
probably know something of his or her subject.  And as I said, yes, the
character aspect may give some people pause.

*Has anyone ever walked off the set/out of the studio either during or before
an interview? If so, why?*

No one has ever walked out in studio. One congressperson was about to in
D.C., but my crew jumped in to stop it from happening. Not I. I just wanted
to capture whatever happened. After that moment, strangely, the
representative went on to have a great time with me. I'm not sure what
precipitated the threat to leave.

*What is your stance on marijuana legalization?*

When we were last in California for the Emmys, people came out of pot
shops with lists of things to say to the doctor so he wold give you
a legal prescription. Anxiety. Sleeplessness. What is the difference
between that and legalization? So if it happened, I don't think the
world would come to an end.

Unless... IT WAS THE POT SMOKERS WHO DREAMT UP SUBPRIME MORTGAGE
BUNDLING IN THEIR DAMNED OPIATE FEVERS????!!!!

When I was young, marijuana was everywhere and basically a joke. Then
in the eighties it was conflated with crack in the just say no days. I
was truly surprised by the return of drug humor and movies in the last
decade.

*Jon Stewart's interview on Rachel Maddow highlighted Jon's philosophy on the
difference between his role and the role of news people like Rachel
Maddow.*

*What, in your mind, is the difference between your responsibility or job and
the responsibility or job of a news anchor or 24 hour news host /
personality?  Do you feel you're fulfilling your role? Do you feel they're
fulfilling theirs?*

*Thanks for doing what you do. You're a funny, funny man.*

I think Jon's appearance on Rachel highlighted his ability to be pretty
sharp after vomiting for eight hours.

As for the 24 cable hosts / personalities fulfilling their
roles, you bet they do -- as those roles are defined by their companies.
If not, they are fired. The fact that the roles they fulfill are hard
to recognize anymore, and have little to do with informing us, but are
instead used to emotionally ""engage"" us with their brand personas,
means I have a steady stream of material.

I too would be fired if I wasn't fulfilling my role as defined by my
company. Happily they define that as comedy, and I agree. I have no real
responsibility beyond working hard on jokes.

rough subjects. I don't like the kids seeing that. He drops the F bomb a wee
too much as well.

I am lucky to have gotten my flavor of fame after reaching man's estate.

Not
that I don't confuse myself at times, but I have a pretty good idea of
who I am, and am sustained by a breathtakingly levelheaded girl who
married me long ago.

----

Thanks so much for all that you redditors did for the rally. I am so
impressed that your idea of coercion is to do good deeds until they are
national news.  CNN and others were reporting your charity blackmail just
days after you started. A new idea, I think, and something to be proud of.
The rally was tremendously supported by you all, along with Facebook, and
Twitter. I have no doubt that your efforts to organize and the joy you
clearly brought to your part of the story contributed greatly to the turnout
and success. Contrary to whatever bullshit quotes you may have heard in the
bullshit press.

See you 'round.

Thanks,

134,IAmA,"I'm working to overturn Citizens United through a constitutional amendment stating corporations are NOT people and money is NOT speech. I’m suing the US Senate to break the gridlock and fighting to preserve a free and open Internet. I’m Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, ask me anything.","[Hi Reddit! I’m Bob Edgar.](http://i.imgur.com/fdbR6.png)

**Thanks for answering, everybody! I've got to get back to my day job, but it's been fun! If you want updates on the work we’re doing, follow us on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/CommonCause) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/commoncause). You can also follow me at [@BobEdgarCC](https://twitter.com/bobedgarcc) Peace... Bob**

You’ve probably noticed, our democracy is a mess. [Citizens United](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=5771765) triggered a tsunami of corporate political spending that threatens our democracy. Meanwhile, the Wall Street titans who crashed our economy are getting richer than ever and still enjoying Washington galas, while Aaron Swartz was aggressively prosecuted for trying to share public documents with the public.  Our government is for sale to the highest bidders.

Right after Watergate, [I was elected to Congress](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4860231) and spent 12 years there pushing back against establishment politicians who cared about their special interest donors more than the people they represented.  When I was in Washington, there were problems, but we could make things work. Today, the system is so badly broken we can’t seem to make any progress.

I became president of [Common Cause](http://www.commoncause.org) in 2007 so we could get Washington working again for regular people like you and me.  Common Cause is a nonpartisan nonprofit org that’s been around for 40 years [fighting for the public interest.](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4764181)

Here’s some of the work we do at Common Cause:

* [Money in politics](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4764307) is one of the biggest problems our democracy faces. That’s why we’re trying to overturn the awful Citizens United decision with a [constitutional amendment](http://amend2012.org/about/) that says corporations aren’t people and money isn’t speech. In 2012, we passed resolutions saying this in [Montana and Colorado](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/11/06/amend-2012-ballot-measure-results/), and we’re already working to do the same thing in Arkansas in 2014.

* We’re also working to stop the ridiculous abuse of the filibuster we’ve seen in the Senate. [When you need a supermajority to even debate an issue](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/12/03/busting-the-filibuster-on-msnbc/), it’s no wonder the 112nd has been the least productive Congress in years. That’s why [we’ve sued the Senate](http://www.alternet.org/story/155430/common_cause_sues_to_restore_majority_rule_to_u.s._senate) to abolish the 60-vote rule and pushing for common sense reform.

* Election 2012 saw an unprecedented [war on voters](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=7719573), with restrictive photo ID laws especially affecting students, low-income folks, people of color, and the elderly. We teamed with civil rights groups, mobilizing volunteers to register as many eligible voters as we could.  On Election Day, [we showed up in person](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/11/07/beating-back-the-bullies-on-election-day/) to ensure ballot bullies didn’t try to intimidate voters.

* Common Cause fights for the free flow of information. We were among many organizations to [stand against SOPA](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/01/18/91-million-legislation/) and we joined transparency advocates worldwide in mourning [Aaron Swartz](http://www.commoncause.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4773613&amp;ct=12188179).  In the months ahead, we will be fighting media consolidation and working to preserve network neutrality.

Here’s some more cool stuff I’d love to talk about:

* I hold five honorary degrees and I’ve been arrested five times for civil disobedience, guess which fact I’m more proud of?

* I wrote the book [“Middle Church”](http://www.amazon.com/Middle-Church-Reclaiming-Faithful-Religious/dp/0743289501) which calls upon progressive people of faith to take back the moral high ground from religious extremists like the Westboro Baptist Church.

* I hear you Redditors LOVE corny puns, which is good news, because so do I. Hit me with your best stuff and I’ll try and keep up.

That’s about it, ask away! **I’ll start answering questions around 1 EST.** Common Cause staff will also be answering questions on the account **Common_Cause**

147,IAmA,IAmA a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon and I wish the Arab world gets as little as 10% of the criticism Israel gets for treating Palestinians. AMA.,"I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/13t6lx/palestinian_here_i_wish_one_day_the_arab_world/) on r/worldpolitics, and somebody told me I should do an AMA, not sure if you'd be interested. I'm sure most of this information is new to you considering the considerable lack of media reporting on the issue. FYI, I'm a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon. Here's the [proof](http://imgur.com/7DcO8).

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400,000 refugees live in camps, deprived of many rights. Refugees don't have any property rights, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, but for over 400,000 of our fellow human beings this is their life: today, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**UPDATE1: Since many here are blaming the PLO and its involvement in the civil war. That's definitely true to a large extent, however you're missing a few points. Most Palestinians refugees were placed in camps in south Lebanon when they arrived. These camps were gradually militarized and became the grounds for operations against Israel and because the PLO had so much power back then, they started making trouble and trying to control part of the country. So had the Lebanon absorbed it's Palestinian population properly, this wouldn't  have happened. Look at the Palestinians of Syria, they didn't make any trouble and didn't start any wars, why? Because they were treated like equal citizens. Also, FYI, Lebanon naturalized more than 100,000 Palestinian Christians and Shiites. Second, who do you think was funding the militarization of the PLO? THE ARAB GOVERNMENTS, whether it's Saudi Arabia or Iraq or some other Arab country.**

**What do I want from Lebanon as a Palestinian refugee? Some of you say that naturalizing 450,000 Palestinians would be a strain on the country. You think that much Palestinian refugees aren't already a  strain? Everyone knows if Lebanon naturalizes Palestinians the whole debt Lebanon has would disappear. I'm not exactly fond of naturalization myself though. However, so many laws can be quickly enacted that will significantly improve the life of a refugee, like property law or proper ID and passports formats that aren't from the 1950's. Also, you say that refugees put a strain on Lebanon. Mind you that a large number of Palestinians work abroad and they all send money to their families in Lebanon so they contribute a lot to the Lebanese economy. Hell, I've been told the Lebanese lira dropped significantly when the PLO left the country in 1982. One more thing, all Lebanese factions and leaders involved in the civil war are now reigning free in the country many of them ministers or MPs, the same people that committed massacres towards their fellow Lebanese. Nobody was punished for the civil war, except for the Palestinians. Why? Because they're not Lebanese, so it's perfectly fine to discriminate against them.**

-------

**Syria**

Surprisingly, refugees there are treated quite well, almost like a citizen. Although this is changing and the Palestinians are being forced to choose sides in the Syrian uprising.

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, perhaps because they needed the population back then. From what I know from my family members living there, there's some discrimination between the natives and Palestinians, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450,000 Palestinians when Arafat declared his support for Saddam during the Gulf war.

**UPDATE2: It seems like a lot of Kuwaitis here are saying that the Palestinians got what they deserved for their support for Saddam. Can you really believe that 400,000 Palestinians earning good money in Kuwait wanted war and death in Kuwait? There might have been a vocal minority, but that's to reason to expel families that were contributing to the Kuwaiti economy.**

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign, however after the 2003 war they were severely targeted with discrimination or killings and the majority fled the country.

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, their residency permit might be revoked. Imagine being born and living in a country your whole life and needing to renew your residency permit every couple of years. Also, a little bit about the occupation of the Gaza strip by Egypt, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also, for a Palestinian refugee it's very hard nowadays to get a work visa to Gulf countries. I was accepted for an internship in Dubai for an American bank but I waited for the visa for 1 and a half months and it never came. I had to relocate to another office. This isn't anecdotal evidence, many complain about this.

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis, tell them to STFU and demand rights for Palestinians in their countries before they complain about Israel. People living glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

I escaped through the jungle to Thailand. I now work for a better future for Cambodia. AMA","In 1975 the Khmer Rouge came to power in Cambodia and killed 2 million Cambodians. I am one of the lucky ones. I survived. I am doing this AMA in hopes you will help me help Cambodia.

My name is Arn Chorn-Pond. There is a book out about my life right now called NEVER FALL DOWN. There has been a PBS documentary about my story called THE FLUTE PLAYER. 

My past under the Khmer Rouge was a dark time and I saw very terrible things. But I have dedicated my future to making life better for Cambodian families. I am doing this AMA today to help with the Magic Music Bus. The mission of the bus is to teach children and families in remote parts of Cambodia about the importance of basic hygiene, literacy and the dangers of landmines that still remain in the ground. We are going to do all of this in a fun way with music. The same music that saved my life, can now make life better for my country.

154,IAmA,"I'm Jerry Rees, Director of ""The Brave Little Toaster"" - ask me anything.","Hi, I’m Jerry Rees, Director and Co-Writer of “The Brave Little Toaster”.

Proof it’s me : http://imgur.com/cHxVO

Me doing Toaster: http://www.jerryrees.com/page3/page3.html

More of me doing Toaster: http://www.jerryrees.com/page105/page105.html

Several years ago, fans who had grown up with the film started getting in touch with me. It was an awesome surprise to hear from the college crowd, who liked BLT as kids, then rediscovered it in their teens.

Various Producers started seeing potential in doing something fresh with the property. Thankfully, Tom Wilhite suggested to that if anyone was going to revive it, they should turn to the Director of the original – the only one of the three that stood the test of time. I truly appreciated it.

In 2009 I started developing a new story. Not a remake, but a proper sequel picking up right where the original left off. True to the spirit of the original, but comfortably nested in the present. And, my dream was to do a live-action CGI mix.  Not because John Lasseter, a good friend, had hoped to do it in CGI, but because I was doing CGI long before all of that, as a Computer Graphics Choreographer on the original TRON.  The TRON stuff had turned John and lots of other folks onto the potential of CGI.

Me on TRON: http://imgur.com/JHXsG

Some of my TRON Stuff: http://www.jerryrees.com/page20/page20.html

So I work the sequel story, and sink into the familiar characters, mixed with new characters and layers of substance and silliness.

A snag happens as it turns out people apparently holding the rights didn’t. Bankruptcy, Reorganized Debtor entities and cease &amp; desist notes abound.

Industry Big Names became my allies, encouraging me to continue with the creative endeavor, helping to sort out the legal knot. Months pass. I’m told to get ready to announce to the fans – we’re almost there!

The bankruptcy group suddenly says a “mystery entity” outbid and walked away.

The Industry Big Names say “Don’t worry, whoever it is will get in touch with you. You were Writer/Director on the original!” But they don’t get in touch.  The current announcement of a remake in fact attempts to delete my role from the original entirely. Can’t do that. Sorry, history is history.

What they did is totally legal. Anyone can buy anything and do to it what they will. But I cared about the original film and its characters dearly, and helped nurture them to life as the fans know them.  I believe I could have brought them alive again in a genuine way that is beyond the understanding and capability of people simply making “product”.

I had planned to invite as many of the Original Team as would be willing to jump in again.  Amazing people.

I had planned to invite the twenty-somethings in the industry, who had grown up with the film to join in.

And I had planned to use a web portal to allow fans from anywhere in the world to participate – actually trying their hand at animating, doing designs, throwing in storyboard ideas, etc.

It was a time for all of us to make Toaster together. By the way, I called the sequel “BLT, homemade.”

Okay, guess that’s enough preamble.

Ask me anything.


**Good evening all** - it's now past 2am and I'll be calling it a night. I plan to do a couple more sessions tomorrow for sure. I'll let you know when I'm here. Your questions and comments were fantastic! Thanks a million, and see you tomorrow, Jerry :-)

HERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING 

* the very cleverly titled DON HERTZFELDT VOLUME 2 DVD is coming out next month and is now available to pre-order. the DVD collects the short film trilogy EVERYTHING WILL BE OK, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU, and IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY,  with the option for the first time to play the whole story together, as a seamless new feature film. the DVD also includes a bunch of other stuff, including miserable cartoon WISDOM TEETH and over 40 minutes of interviews.  here is a trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e6DHjZ-eRg   

everyone pre-ordering the DVD will also get a free 35mm film strip,  clipped from an ITS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY release print (no two are alike),  as well as some other strange things because we don't want them anymore. please find all details over here:  http://bitterfilms.shop.musictoday.com/Dept.aspx?cp=957_58078

* the resulting new feature film shares the same title as the third chapter of the story,  IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY,  and is now turning up in theaters around the USA , with more screenings added before the year is out. it is a somewhat different cut than the one coming to DVD, but sort of not really. come see it on the big screen if you can,  the current list of confirmed cities is posted over at:  http://www.bitterfilms.com   expect one or two surprises

*  i think there was something else but now i can't remember

167,IAmA,"I am a long time Redditor who wants to take our fight for personal freedoms to the next level. I am Dr Michael Ham, physicist, neuroscientist and candidate for the United States Senate from the great State of New Mexico","[Twitter Proof](https://twitter.com/#!/drmichaelham)

[Website](http://drmichaelham.com)

Today's blackout of the internet has been truly awe inspiring. For the first time in my adult life, I saw a diverse community come together with the express purpose of saving some of our freedoms from a Congress that has abandoned the vast majority of Americans. All three of my Congressional representatives are pro-SOPA/PIPA and it has been disheartening to contact them and have their offices ignore a very real threat to our freedom of speech.  

I'm a long time Redditor who got tired of watching my freedoms and future evaporate. So I decided to do something about it.  

Throughout my life, those that represent us in the Federal Government have been selling off my future piece by piece. I was born in 1981 when the Federal Debt was ~1 trillion dollars and the government couldn't wiretap my phone without a warrant. There was never any threat that my family might be indefinitely detained by the government we elected to represent us. The cost of attending a University was manageable for someone working a college level job.  The promise of a society that rewarded hard work, but still took care of those who were less fortunate was still in place.

Like most Americans I pinned my hopes on first one party then the other to restore some sanity to the way government operated. However, this government by the people is no longer for the majority of the people. It has become abundantly clear that government is not broken, it's been hijacked to represent a few narrow interests. There is a segment of society that has always been on the upswing during my life, but it isn't the average American. 

I want to show that there are consequences for these actions. The only way to get our Congress to perform it's duty, is to get a new Congress. We need to set a warning for every future Congress that if they continually subvert the will of the people, they will lose their jobs.

I am running for the United States Senate to replace a PIPA co-sponsor, Jeff Bingaman. I want to put pressure on the primary race and change the debate in the United States to one where we discuss which policies work and which don't. 

Here are [some of my top priorities](http://drmichaelham.com/?p=25) and here is a link to a [Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-ham/sopa-congress_b_1195598.html) I wrote about the danger of SOPA and PIPA to scientific discussion.

I want to be the voice in Congress that stands up for civil liberties and increases opportunities for all Americans.  I am expecting my first child and I want him to grow up in an America that is full of promise once again. 

I don't want to be a Congressman forever. I want to make a positive impact for the people our past several Congresses have left behind: teachers, soldiers, police, firefighters along with the entire middle and lower class. I also want to ensure that we continue to invest in our future as we fix the budget. Then I want to return to my normal life and write books and build apocalypse ready cars.

Congress thinks this (SOPA, PIPA, NDAA, Patriot Act etc) is just going to blow away, but to paraphrase the great American John Paul Jones ""[we] have not yet begun to fight.""  

Edit: Wow! what an incredible turnout. Sorry I can't stay up anymore, I've got work tomorrow. Thanks for all the questions, I will do my best to answer more in the morning.

Edit 2: Front page!  Many asked, so here is my normal Reddit account...[neurn2](http://www.reddit.com/user/neurn2/)

I routinely pick locks, steal access badges, impersonate medical personnel, harvest data and credentials, crack passwords, and utilize various social engineering tactics.

My official title is ""Information Security Consultant."" I have a degree in Information Systems Management, as well as; CCNA, Sec+, and CISA certifications.

176,IAmA,I spent 17 months in a 3rd world country (horrible conditions) jail because of a YouTube video I made. AMA.,"Hey Reddit,

My name is Adnan Hajizada and I am a dissident and ex-prisoner of conscience from Azerbaijan. In 2009 I posted a video that mocked the ridiculous overspending (purchasing donkeys from Germany at USD 40,000 each) by the Government of Azerbaijan. Two weeks later, my friend and I were attacked and severely beaten up by government hired thugs while dining in one of the local cafes. We went and complained about the event to the Police. Eventually the thugs were let go, my friend and I were arrested on trumped up charges of hooliganism and causing minor bodily harm. We spent 17 months in jail. The case caused wire international outcry, eventually Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama spoke on our behalf and we were freed on parole. 

I have been lurking here for a while, decided that the first post should be an AMA about myself. Hope this will be interesting.

180,IAmA,"We are the Firefox User Experience team, this is your chance to tell us about your pet peeves!","**Update:** OK guys, it's been fun! We'll answer questions intermittently, but we've been doing this for 10 hours now, and need some food. You're all great, thanks for all the questions! :)

Almost three years ago, we hosted a session here on Reddit where you got to tell us [everything that annoyed you about Firefox 3.6](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/boipt/i_work_on_the_firefox_user_experience_team_and/). This led to an effort at Mozilla called “Paper cuts”, see [blog post](http://limi.net/articles/papercuts/) and [slides](http://www.scribd.com/doc/31643187/Firefox-4-Paper-Cuts-Alexander-Limi-Firefox-User-Experience). We got over 2000 comments back then, and we'd like to hear from you again!

What we're after is the “paper cuts”, the stuff that gets in the way or annoys you about Firefox on a daily basis, and that we could help get prioritized. 

**Ground rules:** (of course, you can ask us anything, but this will save some time)

* One idea/papercut per comment, please — that way they can be voted up individually.
* No trolling in bug reports linked from this thread, please — if there’s already a bug in Bugzilla for it, we take it seriously, no need to post “why hasn't this been fixed yet‽”
* We love all the other browsers on the market (yes, really!), and several of our close friends work on competing products. Competition makes everyone better, and the web is better off for it. No “browser X sucks, browser Y is the best” comments necessary.
* Make sure you have tried a recent version of Firefox (preferrably with a [reset profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems)) before commenting. Firefox has come leaps and bounds lately, and has best-in-class memory usage, massively improved startup time, etc. So make sure you're commenting on the product we're actually shipping, instead of the Firefox you used a year ago. :)
* We will not answer any questions about Rampart.

**TL;DR — some questions that are asked repeatedly:**

* Problems? Slow startup, slow shutdown, lots of memory used? [Reset Firefox fixes most issues](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems).
* If that doesn't fix your problem, talk to our [awesome support team](http://support.mozilla.org).
* Private browsing without shutting down the current set of tabs is coming in Firefox 20 (get the beta if you want it right now!)
* Flash issues are hard (focus stealing keypresses, volume control), due to the way Flash works. We're still trying to find ways to fix this. We hear you!
* We are currently working on Australis (the visual redesign), here's a screenshot of the UX build this morning: http://i.imgur.com/VdQ99bc.png

**Remember, Firefox is *your* project — it's the only mainstream browser not owned by a massive corporation — so help us make it better!**

185,IAmA,"The govt, Interpol and the mob chased my family 
out of our home country and seized our assets 
illegally. My mom, the PM's ""advisor"", stabbed me 
in the chest repeatedly when I was nine then killed 
herself. AMA","**UPDATE - Apparently the Slovak news media have decided its a great idea to quote me out of context, slander my name and use my post that I made to try and help people as a vehicle to attack my family. Classic example of the rampant corruption in Slovak government and media. They did not ask for permission to use my pictures. They did not ask for my opinion, and they translated my writing in a very vicious and derogatory manner. It makes me look like I hate my father and step mother, which is extremely far from the truth. They have supported me as best as they could. And while my father was busy dealing with the political terror and trying to save his reputation from baseless slander and allegations, my stepmom was always there to support me emotionally.**

My father was the privatiser of a prominent spa and several hotels, and former owner of a computer company and a Slovak bank accused of Russian mob activity.
 
My mother was the ""right hand"" to a former prime minister of Slovakia. And no, I have no clue what that means. At one point he said that ""she did more for Slovakia than the entire cabinet."" She had no political training. She was an opera singer, and an alcoholic suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. It's on record that she told reporters that she expected me to become the prime minister of Slovakia. 

I was born 1991 in Bratislava, Slovakia. I grew up in what amounted to complete hermetic isolation in mansions and hotels. My parents were barely present and I was raised by staff, babysitters and bodyguards. I was so emotionally neglected that my first spoken word was ""auto"" instead of mom or dad. I barely have memories of spending time with my parents outside of being dragged to political events in little tuxedos and Christmas. Completely alienated from the world around me, I sought refuge on the internet starting at the age of 9.

If I remember correctly, the trouble began when I was around 7 years old. There was increased pressure to become secretive, and I realized that there was something wrong about the fact that I was never allowed to go anywhere without two tall and heavily armed men following me around. My father was wary of everyone, including my classmates. Nobody was allowed at my house, and I was not allowed to go anywhere. 

I remember my greatest accomplishment of 'freedom', which was when I was actually allowed to go outside and only had to go with ONE bodyguard to pick up a Big Mac. I was forbidden to go outside due to continued threats on our lives, which included dead animals being mailed to our house. At one point I witnessed a carbomb being defused from a car that they falsely assumed was ours.

Around this time, my father began to exhibit signs of poisoning and had to be hospitalized. The diagnosis was heavy metal poisoning, possibly infused into his food or drinking water. Thankfully he recovered. There were numerous scares about snipers, and I was told to keep away from windows anywhere else except our house (because ours were custom built and bulletproof, as was our main car).

A year later we had to leave Slovakia in the middle of the night, staying in a hotel in Austria for several weeks. Why we had to move was unclear to me at this time. I was not frightened, but confused. I didn't really know what was going on, so I had no reason to be scared. Apparently Austria had granted my father asylum for the charges he faced. It took a decade of expensive and difficult legal proceedings to finally clear his name and get the government to admit that the charges were fraudulent. 

My mom began acting increasingly irrational. She locked herself out of her car multiple times, burst into tears randomly for no reason, and threw away jewelery and clothing in excess of $5000. One time she put a $10,000+ opera dress into the donation bin. Some homeless person must be looking quite snazzy by now. Humor: an easy way to cope.

One night in October 2000, when I was 9 years old, my mother burst into my room while I was sleeping. ""DIE!"" She screamed at the top of her lungs. The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was her wielding a large kitchen knife above her head and her cross necklace swaying as she ran towards my bed. She tore the blanket off me and began stabbing me in the chest repeatedly. I tried to defend myself with my hands and severed a finger in the process. There was blood everywhere. The walls and the bed were painted crimson, and it trickled onto the carpet. I felt serene and stoned off endorphines. Everything was blurry and dreamlike. It didn't seem like any of this was actually happening to me.

(In light of new information, she apparently suffered from Capgras delusion as pointed out by various commenters)

My father heard me scream for my life, ran downstairs (they were sleeping in separate rooms), and threw her down the stairs before calling the ambulance and the police. According to news reports, she then stabbed herself in the stomach and jumped out of the first floor balcony, breaking several ribs. My last memory of this night was passing out on a gurney while the EMTs talked at me in German. 

Luckily they managed to save my finger. I spent 6 months bedridden in a hospital. I had to relearn how to walk because she had damaged my spine. The knife went all the way through my body, and there are scars on both my front and back. 

 When reporters asked me how I felt, I said I was upset that my body was damaged and that I wished to murder my mother with a brick if she was ever released. My mom survived the jump and stabbing herself in the stomach and was put into a high security mental hospital. She was there for a year. During that time her sister tried to steal from us, and our housekeeper had to kick her out, literally throwing her suitcases on the street. 

My dad later married the nanny, and now they have a daughter. My stepmom has completed her law degree and now has a prominent law firm.

Every school I went to, this story followed me. Even though I WAS THE VICTIM, they were afraid of me and I was expelled for 'bad publicity' and 'scaring other students'. Teachers did not respect my privacy, and took any sickdays that I had as an opportunity to tell my story to the class at great lengths. I had to go to 7 different schools as a result of this. Their rationalization was that I would likely stab someone because it happened to me. At one point a school official asked for a considerable bribe to keep me in school, but my father's assets had been completely frozen, making him unable to pay even if he wanted to. We went from millions to almost nothing.

Note: There's a lot I left out due to space.

Here are photos of my scars, 11 years after the incident (possibly NSFW). Excuse my unkempt appearance, I just woke up and made no effort to shave/prepare. [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/CQC3i)

UPDATE - I only realized too late that the details pertaining to my stepmom have been claimed by my aunt in an attempt to smear our family and portray them in a negative light. I remembered that they have first been living together in 2003, and not any earlier.  


""I have made the reddit AMA post to try and make my situation understood, not be skewed into scandal. After the original post, I have realized that the accusations of an affair were the fabricated musings of my aunt Anita, who tried to damage our lives. Because I was still a child when this happened, her words stuck with me too deeply. I realized too late that this was just her way of getting back at us. I wrote the original post after a stressful day, and was confused by the dates.
The claim of my father's 'affair' surfaced only as late as 2003, which was a long time after these events have transpired. This was an attempt by Anita to spin the story in her favor. She threatened to do this and asked my father to give her my mother's old car as blackmail. When he did not oblige, she started spreading these rumors and lies.

To put things into perspective, Janka has always been supportive and helpful, more than possibly anyone else ever was to me. Growing up she was the only person I had any kinship with.

Anita on the other hand, hit me in the face the first time she saw me after I got stabbed. And all that because I accidentally dropped a dinner plate.

Saying that I was 'interested in UFO' is also skewing the situation, since the article conveniently leaves out that this was when I was 10 to 12 years old. This is not a relevant part of who I am today.

I tried to write my story out as a way of coping, and letting people know how terrifying life can be when something like that happens to you. I do not see much of a point in this prodding and stirring for the sake of entertainment. This is exactly what has confused certain aspects of my story, because my aunt has always been cooperative with news agencies to portray us in the absolute worst possible light.

My story was part my own subjective reality growing up, and part the incommensurate fiction that I have been force-fed by my greedy aunt and her posse.

If you are taking as factual evidence the memories of a child under the age of ten, I would reconsider your stance on reality. I have since spent more time contemplating the transpired events and realized that my timeline had not been accurate, nor had the reason for my mother's suicide been accurate.

She had killed herself for trying to murder me, something that was difficult for me to accept emotionally, and what my parents tried to shield me from. The only voice that rang loud was that of my manipulative aunt, who managed to sway my perspective enough to generate this fiasco.

I write this with deep regret, as my misremembering of her sleazy verbal manipulation of a child as factual evidence. There was no affair, and the distance between my father's nightmares of the incident and their relationship spans SEVERAL YEARS.

Moja teta 'affairu' vymislela a vtliekla mi to do hlavy, co som si uvedomil az ked som porozsmislal nad tim, presne kedy sa co stalo. Do 2003 o tom nic nebolo, ani Janka u nas nebivala !!!

Nikdo nebere do uvahy ze co spuosobilo vsetko bol politicky terror! Nobody considers that what caused the ENTIRE course of events was political terror.""

People who have questions concerning the political landscape and what really happened, I suggest you look at [Markiza.tv](http://markiza.tv) . 


**TLDR - My family who were once part of the government of Slovakia ended up being chased out of the country, lost their wealth, my dad was poisoned, and my schizophrenic mom stabbed me multiple times when I was 9. Then she committed suicide in the mental hospital. We were victims of political terror. The stigma got me expelled multiple times.**"

My name is El Sawyer. I was sentenced to 8-20 years for a shooting when I was 17. I served 8 years in SCI Graterford, Pennsylvania's largest maximum security prison. While I was incarcerated I had the chance to learn film/video production. When I came home from prison I dedicated myself to community service and video production, and am now a director of a community arts non-profit in Philly called The Village of Arts and Humanities (www.villagearts.org)

Re-entry and recidivism is a huge issue, and through my own struggles with returning to society, I felt the need to create a film about the topic to shed light on some of these issues. The film is called Pull of Gravity (www.pullofgravityfilm.com) and follows three men (I'm one of them) in different stages of reintegration. The US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of PA reached out to me three years ago to lead classes for at-risk youth using video as a violence prevention tool. From the success of those classes they have put their full support behind the film.

Trailer for the film: https://vimeo.com/57340780

I'm happy to talk about what led me to prison, being in prison, the filmmaking process, etc etc.

Ask me anything.

EDIT: The guy I shot did NOT die. He lived and testified against me in court.

Since 2008, I’ve also served as the co-chair of President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), which advises the White House on matters of science and technology -- including health, advanced manufacturing, energy policy, information technology, nanotechnology and national security.

In addition to my own scientific work, I’ve taught MIT’s Introductory Biology for the past 20 years.

I will be writing verbatim of what he says to the questions. I am typing just to keep up with the comments and I am sure he wants to watch baseball on his first day off after 5 shifts of 12 hours in a row.)

I have worked as a Emergency Room Physician since 1991. I have traveled all over US; and have worked in 11 states. I have calculated a guesstimate that I have treated about 100,000 patients. That is based on hours worked times average patients seen per hour. (Since people are calling BS....2.5 patients per hour x 165 hours per month x 12 months in a year x 22 years = 108,900 patients. That doesn't include residencies, I often see more patients per hour and work more hours than used in the math.)  

I have seen a lot in my career as I have worked in small towns to large cities, affluent areas to more impoverished ones, and special events such as the '96 Olympics. I currently travel to 5 different states to work in contracted emergency rooms.

I have quite intersting stories, experiences, opinions, etc to share. Ask me anything except why it burns when you pee.

Outside of my work on Onion News Empire, you may also know me from my roles as Hank Kingsley on the sitcom The Larry Sanders Show and George Bluth, Sr. on Arrested Development, the fourth season of which premiers May 26 exclusively on Netflix. I have also appeared in the comedy films City Slickers and The Hangover, and the television series Three’s Company, Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, and Bob’s Burgers. 

But enough about me. Allow me to introduce the co-creators of Onion News Empire, who will be answering your questions under the handle OnionNewsEmpire. They haven't had one of their famous catchphrases immortalized [in t-shirt form](http://www.oldskoolhooligans.com/larry-sanders-show-t-shirt-hank.html), but maybe one day they'll get there:

213,IAmA,Roger Ebert,"Seven months ago, there was a [\[Request]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a05if/iama_request_roger_ebert/) for Roger Ebert to do an IAmA. I contacted him myself on Wed, Nov 4, 2009, using the comments box on one of his blog posts. I was delighted to get a reply!

After he accepted to take questions (I offered the number 10), I made an IAmA post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a0zbk/roger_ebert_ask_him_anything/). 1,143+ comments!!! 1440 points!!! Thank you for the overwhelming response!

After a full day, I took the top 30 or so comments and made a new post so that they could be scored without bias of when they were posted. I then took the top 15 comments and sent them to Roger, saying that he could pick any 10 of them. He agreed to respond to them.

I sent a few reminders over the months, but we all know he's been through troubles with his health and such. I got lots of complaint threads and messages in the meantime, but everything was out of my control, really.

Anyway, he sent me an email an hour ago with his answers! Without further ado...

&gt;**walter\_p\_henson**

&gt;what's the one movie that has stumped you (as far as making a decision on whether you enjoyed it or didn't) the very most in your career?

Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy."" I keep waiting to see it again. It keeps going wrong for me. The characters of Rupert Pupkin and Masha are unforgettable. Jerry Lewis is pitch-perfect. NAME is dreamy. I am nagged by a suspicion I'm wrong. I've approved of many leer movies. But in my sort of generic approach (Does this movie succeed in what it sets out to do, or what we expect it to do?) I dunno. I will have to see it for a fourth or fifth time.

&gt;**dippyT**

&gt;How has age affected how you view movies over the years? By that I mean, do you think you've gotten better at discerning what movies are worth seeing by having experience with the medium over a long period of time, or do you think a more innocent viewpoint, not marred by technical knowledge such as influence or technique, leads to a more ""pure"" watching experience - one that allows a person to more easily experience the core emotional elements that make a movie enjoyable or meaningful without being distracted by technicalities?

The more movies you see and write about, the more you know about them. Consider baseball. The ""innocent"" crowd member sees a bunch of guys running after a little ball while earring funny costumes. The Cubs fan sees inevitable tragedy unfolding.

&gt;**rboymtj**

&gt;How has your bout with cancer affected your viewpoints on things like controversial movies, politics and life in general? It seems that after your illness/voice problems began you've been publishing more politically motivated (and wonderful, I might add) columns and articles.

It was a wake-up call about my mortality. About a man about to be hanged, Dr. Johnson said something like this: ""The knowledge hat one is to die in the morning sharpens the mind greatly."" I don't expect to die in the morning, but the principle holds.

&gt;**rdewalt**

&gt;What is your ""Guilty Pleasure"" movie?

Russ Meyer's ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" John Waters called it ""The best movie that ever has been made, and ever will be made."" That tells you something right there.

&gt;**Khiva**

&gt;Are there are any of your reviews that are particularly proud of - ones that brought recognition to an unknown film, or which you feel captured something nobody else quite understood, or which were just unusually fun to write?

I am proud that I was the first person to ever write a review of a Martin Scorsese film, and I was absolutely right about him. I wrote about ""2001"" the day before its premiere, and my praise was joined by many early criticisms. Recently, I've been excited to champion the work of Ramin Bahrani (""Man Push Cart,"" ""Goodbye, Solo""). My choice for best film of the decade was ""Synecdoche, New York,"" and on my blog I received dozens of messages in fervent agreement. Charlie Kaufman's film is building a reputation as challenging but profound.


&gt;**Paulinboots**

&gt;You are credited as the first major critic to realize what an incredible force in cinema Martin Scorsese was destined to become. What currently developing directors will be the most recognized in 20 years?

Ramin Bahrani.


&gt;**qgyh2**

&gt;Ever watched a movie that was too disturbing / shocking to complete / review (if so what was it)?

I walked out of ""Caligula,"" but more because of disgust and shock. Otherwise, no.


&gt;**stephiem**

&gt;What is your process of reviewing? Specifically, take notes during the film or do any outside research? If the film was based off of a book, do you read it?

I take written notes sometimes. I do not go out of my way to read the book, although often I may have. Although my reviews often discuss the source material, it's not a question of whether the movie is ""faithful"" to the book. The question is, how good a film is it? New things interested me less than whether ""Twilight Two"" deviated from the novel.


&gt;**lulz**

&gt;Are there any films you particularly disliked when you first reviewed them, but years later saw the film again and greatly enjoyed? Or vice versa?

Not particularly, although I am open to shifts in opinion. What we thought then need not be what we think no. We grow, we learn, we change.



&gt;**tantric\_fart**

&gt;What is your most favorite personal memory of Gene Siskel that at the same time defines the kind of person he was (i.e., an event, a joke he told, act of kindness, something he said, etc.). Details of this memory would be much appreciated. He seemed like a genuine soul and it was fun to watch the two of you worked together.

My appreciation of him only grows over the years. He was formidably intelligent and much of his criticism grew from his skill as a reporter. He liked to say he ""covered the movie beat."" Some may dismiss that; he used it to apply inflicting honesty. I'm glad so many of our old shows survive on the net, because he was so funny.


&gt;**giantgiant**

&gt;On the first viewing of a movie, do you find yourself paying more attention to the mechanics of movie making (IE ""What a bad shot,"" or ""What good lighting/sound,"" or ""That character draws attention away from the main plot in a bad way,"") Or do have the ability to let the mechanics go and watch the movie like a ""regular"" movie viewer; to 'get lost in the story'?

The movie informs me how to look at it. In an ideal situation, I'm looking at everything all at once, just as an experienced sports fan is caught up in the excitement of a game, yet simultaneously observes strategy and technical details.


&gt;**jhaluska**

&gt;Has anybody ever thanked you for a negative review of one of their films?

In an ad, David Lynch once proudly proclaimed, ""Two Thumbs Down!""


&gt;**tdrizzle**

&gt;What do you think of meta-review sites like rottentomatoes and metacritic. Do you think they serve a good purpose, or do you not feel you can get a fair feel of a movie from aggregating reviews?

They tell you which way the wind is blowing, but no good review can be understood from a sentence or two. I think people understand that. My site gets a lot of hits from such sites, and IMDb, MRQE and MovieReviewIntelligence.


&gt;**juliusseizure**

&gt;In your opinion, how important is re-watchability when judging a movie to be great?

Derek Malcolm, the British critic, says his definition of  a great movie is: ""One I can't stand the thought of never seeing again.""

AMA","   I am a 20 years old college student that proudly attends Marist College. My left arm is frozen in a 90 degree angle and confined to my side. My right arm is also in a 90 degree angle, but I am able to fold it to reach my face and feed myself. I am unable though to stretch my arms out. When I was younger, bones grew near the ribs locking them into place. As i grew older, it caused to me to get severe scoliosis. This is a progressive disease meaning that the older I get, the worse I will become. People with FOP get these things called flare-ups where our muscles will really swell up and the bone will grow, limiting movement until the body tells it to stop. I am currently having one in my hip and thigh and it extremely painful. My chances of not being able to walk are very slim. There is currently no cure or treatment as of February 15, 2013, but there is hope because a clinical trial will start later this year. There is still a struggle  and it could be years till I am able to receive the treatment.A student at my school is helping me raise awareness by doing various fundraising activities. On April 7th she is hosting a ‘Field Day’ for the student body, with all donations going to the International Fop Association for research. 

However, since not everyone is able to attend she created a Fundly account to help raise donations and awareness. If you want to help in any way, big or small, please do at

236,IAmA,"[BY REQUEST] I AmA polyglot (multilingual person) from Ireland. I only spoke English when I was 21, but now I speak 10 languages and can sign ASL. I've given a TEDx talk to inspire adult language learners. AMA","A video I recorded (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITzFRlVhMVs) is currently on the front page of /r/videos and several people have requested that I do an IAmA [in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/y5pra/black_guy_and_white_guy_speak_a_dozen_languages/).

I am NOT naturally talented in languages. I took German and Irish (Gaeilge) in school, and barely passed German and had to drop down to a lower level in Irish for a basic university entrance requirement. I have a degree in Electronic Engineering and when I moved to Spain at the age of 21, **I only spoke English**. I even managed to spend six months in Spain and not learn the language to any useful degree. I've given a TEDx talk about my story and what I changed to become the polyglot I am today.

I've had a completely different approach since then and *can now speak ten languages* and sign American Sign Language. To watch **my TEDx talk**, and then see me use several of my languages with a native speaker in a spontaneous interview, **[check out the videos on this page](http://speakfromday1.com/in-action/)** ([here's a direct link to watch my TEDx talk](http://speakfromday1.com/tedx/)) or *[my Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/irishpolyglot)*. About six of these languages are genuinely **fluent** - this would be a [European Common Framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) level B2-C2, with officially recognized diplomas in several, and the others are various degrees of conversational. So for example, my Spanish is C2 (mastery) and I've worked as an electronic engineer in the language, but my Chinese is B1 (conversational, but still hesitant).

I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about my thoughts on how to go about learning a language efficiently.

For proof that I am who I say I am, you'll see that I'm pretty active on Reddit, Youtube, twitter etc. and it's always under the handle irishpolyglot.

Here are some typical questions people ask me:


**1. What's your secret? Are you naturally talented, or did you grow up in a multilingual environment?**

No. I did poorly in languages in school and only spoke English when I was 21. My secret is that I stopped using excuses like ""I'm too old"", ""I've got no language gene"", ""People will laugh at me"" and other absolute nonsense, and I focused on speaking my target language every single day. A communicative approach, rather than a studious one, will get you much further. I do study, but it's based around my spoken sessions.

**2. I see from your blog that you travel a lot. That's all well and good for you to be in the country, but I can't! I guess I can't learn my target language until I'm rich or go on holiday?**

Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, travelling as the core of your ""strategy"" is a terrible idea. I've met thousands of ""expats"" living abroad with nothing in the language.
I always tell people **it depends on your attitude, not your latitude** (and longitude). I actually learned most of my Portuguese while living in France, and in September I plan to learn a language totally unrelated to anything I've ever learned before, to fluency in three months, in the wrong continent, to prove how it's what you do, not where you do it, that matters.
You can talk to people on Skype via many sites (one I like is [italki](http://fi3m.com/italki)), or you can meet up in person! The video that is doing so well on /r/videos shows me and my other polyglot friend speak a dozen languages **in a mall in Ohio**. Not New York City, not at a language conference, but in Columbus, Ohio. There are always opportunities if you open your eyes or try harder! I also like to use Couchsurfing.org and search the city I'm in for the target language, and invite that person out for a coffee. 
You can meet up in person with native speakers of many languages if you are in any large city, or you can practice via Skype. Some languages are a little harder to do this than others, but once you find ONE person to spend time with consistently, you are good to go!


**3. Should I go out and buy Rosetta Stone/Pimsleur etc. What books do you recommend?**

[I reviewed Rosetta Stone for my blog](http://www.fluentin3months.com/rosetta-stone-review/) while learning Dutch. It's the first or second result when you Google ""review of Rosetta Stone"" and one of the few reviews on the Internet that isn't actually a pitch (for RS, or for a competing product). I've written a book myself that I sell on a site separate to my blog, but I say specifically not to buy it as an alternative to RS - it's only for people who are more curious about how I learn languages myself.

Basically, I find RS to be marketing geniuses. You can't miss them in America. But the product itself is simply not good. They copy and paste 90% of their content to all languages, which means you simply are not learning what you need to. Obviously a course needs to be unique for each language and its subtleties. The course is also too expensive. It has been effective for some people, but I feel it's because they've spent so much money that they feel obliged to use RS and other (more useful) resources.

[I've also reviewed Pimsleur](http://www.fluentin3months.com/pimsleur/) and a few other products. The bottom line is that there IS no product that will solve all of your problems. This is basically throwing money at the issue. What you need to do is learn a few words and phrases and use them immediately with a human being. I got so frustrated with this product-focus that I actually wrote a ""sales pitch"" for [the best product in the world, HB 2.0](http://www.fluentin3months.com/hb) (Human Beings).

Note that if your focus is just on passing examinations, or something else like reading a book, rather than communication with people, then a lot of what I say becomes less relevant. **Not me, or anyone else has the ultimate solution to learning a language**, this is all down to what is relevant for you. Many people do the opposite of what I say, and more power to them because they have very different goals. The great thing about the Internet, Youtube etc. is you can get to know other polyglots and see where their focus lies and see if you'd jive more with their advice. ""One size fits all"" products are always a terrible idea.

If you are really curious though, I tend to invest in ""Teach Yourself"", ""Colloquial"", and Lonely Planet phrasebooks when starting off with most languages. I find these teach you to get by pretty well, and are light on grammar. From there you can advance quicker. I would study grammar when I have a base, never intensively at the start.


**4. Does speaking a lot of languages get you laid a lot?**

I get asked this a LOT!! Look, I'll admit that I kind of got inspired to become multilingual partially because the Brazilian guy I met (mentioned at the start of my TEDx talk) had ladies drooling over him. I thought it was because he spoke all these languages, but in fact it was because he was charming, attentive and a nice guy, while also being assertive and a man of the world.

And that's what it all comes down to in the end. After my first four years of travelling, I think I spoke five languages, which is already ""impressive"" enough. I made the mistake of saying this immediately when I would meet a pretty girl, thinking she'd be so impressed with me that we'd be going home within five minutes. It never ever happened. It's as bad as waving a Rolex or pointing to your Porsche. That doesn't impress people ever. Some girls are attracted to guys with money, but if you come across as an insecure asshole then that charm vanishes and the cute and charming bum becomes way more interesting. (For the record, I'm not rich. I earn about the same wage as people I graduated university with, but I am a minimalist and this helps me travel easier. Living in foreign countries also helps you leverage currency differences to your advantage)

So no, speaking a bunch of languages does NOT get you laid. It's the kind of person that you are. It's true that now because I speak more languages, I am open to more opportunities to meet more interesting people. I travel a lot and have learned to become less shy and approach more people (guys and girls), and this naturally leads to more opportunities. It's true that if I happen to speak the girl's native language, my chances increase dramatically, but actually you only need to speak ONE language for this, not a dozen.

As it happens, I'm not travelling the world to shag every girl in sight, and it's a pity when people think I have ""a girl in every port"". I prefer quality over quantity, and building deeper connections than having a string of empty one night stands. Being a world traveller influences my love life (for better and worse) more than speaking many languages does.

Speaking more languages *does* make you more of a ""man of the world"", which is of course an attractive quality. DON'T learn languages to get laid though. You'll be terribly disappointed. Work on becoming a more interesting person. If more girls are interested in me, it's actually because I can LISTEN in more languages, not because I can speak in more of them.


**5. What's the hardest language in the world?**

I've learned Hungarian and Czech to basic conversational level (haven't maintained them though, my ten non-English languages I maintain are Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Esperanto, Irish (Gaeilge), American Sign Language, Mandarin and Dutch), dabbled in Thai and recently learned Chinese. And you know what the hardest one out of all of these has been?

Spanish.

Yep - not Chinese, not Hungarian. Spanish. When you look at a language from a purely linguistic viewpoint, comparing grammatical concepts or how many cognates it has with your mother tongue, it's easy to think that you could theoretically come up with a ""hardest"" language. 

But this ignores the psychological aspect. The hardest language in the world is what is hardest FOR YOU. Any generic list can never take this into account. I had the most inefficient learning approach (for a language I genuinely tried to learn) for Spanish. It took me almost a year to get the stage of OK conversational in Spanish, whereas it took me about five months to get to that same level in Chinese. I went on to improve my Spanish after this, but the point is that my APPROACH made the language hard, not the language itself.

If you are passionate about a language, then don't waste time comparing it to others. Some people like to learn a language *because* it seems hard (I'm not a fan of this; seems like a rather superficial reason to take on a means of communication with human beings), but for most of us this is nothing but intimidation, or the ego of someone who is a native speaker or who has learned it and wants you to think they are smart because of that.

Yes of course, if you have no personal attachment or motivation to learn languages and impersonally compare them, one language will come out as much harder than another to learn. But if you love Japanese Manga, then maybe this would be the ""easiest"" language (in passion) for you to learn, or if your family is Czech then you'll dive into that with way more enthusiasm than you ever would for Spanish or French.

Don't compare language. Learn the language you want to learn and learn it well!


**Bonus Q. 6 How do you learn so many languages??**

One language at a time. Focus, stick to it until you get to a very comfortable level, and then start another one, while maintaining the previous one. I've seen people try to learn two or three languages from scratch at once, and sometimes it works, but for most of us this is too confusing.

My fluent languages are a part of me now. I lived my life through them and have friends in these languages. I focused entirely on each one for several months or over a year, so it's a means of communication to me that I switch into.

I don't mix them up so often because I try to use them frequently. This allows me to compartmentalise them in my mind (I do other things like associate body language, posture, voice with one language so it's harder for another language to invade it).

Focus is the secret. If you are patient, and stick to one language that you are GENUINELY passionate about, then after you have reached a great fluent or mastery level in that language, you will be may more skilled to take on the next. It does get easier - not necessarily because your brain is tuned to language learning, but because your personality is. If you gain the CONFIDENCE to do it once, then you can do it again.

People don't realize how important confidence and ambition are in language learning. It isn't about good memory, but genuinely using it. This is how languages work - it's you and another person talking. Make it about that rather than sticking to the books and you'll be good to go!



*
EDIT 1: Several people are asking **Have you ever overheard people talking about you or dissing you thinking you don't understand?**, so I'll answer it here.

I have found indeed come across people talking about me in general, curious about this white traveller (especially in non-touristy places) but to this day, never bad mouthing me that I was aware of. In China this year they kept referring to me as an American 美國人, rather than simply foreigner 外國人, since I'm white and they presume most white people are Americans. I found that a little annoying, but hardly offensive. They'd say this loudly enough that I was bound to hear it, but presumed that I couldn't understand them.

And one girl on a metro in Taiwan said to her friend I was cute, and got so embarrassed when I said 謝謝! (Thanks!)

Also, another question coming up a lot is **What language do you think in?**
Generally, at any given time, I'm focused on improving a particular language. With this in mind, I force myself to voice-over in my head in that language. So even in the early stages, I'd try to *think* ""Oh damn! I'm out of milk! I'll have to go to the store"" or ""That girl's cute!"" etc. in the target language. It's unnatural at first, but soon I get used to it.

Right now I'm in the Gaeltacht in Ireland and think about such things in Irish. It's a conscious decision that keeps me in the flow. If you are curious about what language I **dream** in, you'll get that and a few other FAQs on this page: http://www.fluentin3months.com/learner-faq/

AMA! (~4 year follow-up)","**If you'd like to help** the Indiegogo campaign aimed at creating new Navajo Language learning materials by collecting and archiving the spoken word of Navajo elders -- a 'learn from the elders' approach to cultural preservation -- you can do so here: Link -&gt; [http://igg.me/at/navajo/x/4253969](http://igg.me/at/navajo/x/4253969.).

Hi Reddit! Nearly 4 years ago I submitted an AMA ([Reddit, IAMA Native American Indian who lives on the reservation, or the U.S's third world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a1hcg/reddit_iama_native_american_indian_who_lives_on/)) in which many of you asked some good questions about where I live and how I grew up. I invite you to ask me again and I'll provide as much insight as possible.

As an update since then, I've started a Navajo language teaching website ([Navajowotd.com](http://navajowotd.com)) to give back. As you may know, the Navajo culture and language suffered, and still does, from an effort to extinguish it by various outside influences. It is my hope that more people will learn Navajo so that they can speak to their elders, and to encourage a dialogue about the importance of cultural preservation.

If you'd like to help the effort to preserve the Navajo culture, I started an [Indiegogo campaign](http://igg.me/at/navajo/x/4253969) to begin collecting and archiving the spoken word of Navajo elders, which I've named the Diné Bizaad project (Diné: the people; bizaad: his/their words). Here's the link: [http://igg.me/at/navajo/x/4253969](http://igg.me/at/navajo/x/4253969).

I also am on a walk that began a week ago at the western border of the Navajo Nation in Arizona and am now in New Mexico. This is to spread awareness of a pivotal moment in our history as Navajo people known as the Long Walk (Hwéeldi). In the 1860s, my ancestors were forcibly removed from their homes to a barren reservation east of Albuquerque, NM. Many of my people died, but their resistance and subsequent return via the Treaty of Bosque Redondo, led to the sovereignty we possess today. The treaty allowed the US government to take Navajo children into boarding schools, where a long line of mistreatment began in the government's pursuit to eradicate the Navajo culture. My walk to is to create a dialogue around this painful moment in our history as we are a few years from the 150th year since the return of our ancestors to our homelands.

I look forward to your questions!

244,IAmA,"In honor of memorial day, I am an 88 year old WW2 aerial photographer/vet","My granddaughter will be asking me the questions and she will be quoting me word-for-word.
I was 18 years old, from a family of 8 brothers. I was a photo recon and served in the South Pacific from 1943-1946. I was a receiver of a Purple Heart, when I was shot in the ear by the Japanese after I had been taking pictures of bases. I now am almost deaf in that ear.
In  Leyte, Phillipines, I lived in a village where I owned a pet monkey and took pictures of the locals. I was a part of the 8-Ballers, which was a photo reconnoissance squadron.
I am very knowledgeable in cameras, planes, and other pieces of technology. I even have an iPad that I research on daily.
In 2010, I took the Honor Flight, where I was sent to DC with fellow veterans to visit memorials and speak.
My experiences from the war are some of the fondest memories I have, and I would love to answer any questions you have. I have great recollection of things and am open to anything you might wonder about.

Protools on a computer, and an MPC. 2) how did i ""make it""? a combination of luck and persistence. that's the best i can tell you. do it for the fun of it, so if it doesnt take off, you arent at a loss. 3) whats my ""inspiration""? this is almost too broad to answer, but in short, A) life, and B) music is a part of the fabric of my life at this point, so it is just there, for better or worse, at all times.  it's how i've come to interface with the world in many ways, so i dont really need to look for it. there are an infinite number of things in music that i will never learn/accomplish/do, so its not like im constantly exhausting its' possibilities. hope that makes sense."

My name is Jim Graves, and I am running for Congress.

I want to replace Rep. Michele Bachmann because she is part of the inflexible extreme. While her freewheeling comments have made her a national media phenomenon, they have not added one new job to the 6th District of Minnesota.

I started AmericInn Hotels with my wife Julie in 1979 with only $2,000 in the bank.  Since then, I have created thousands of jobs and balanced as many budgets. 

I have never run for office before, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to give back and serve the community that has given me so much. I look forward to providing the people of the 6th District the representation they truly deserve and so desperately need.

We have three debates coming up next week that we are very excited about. We wanted to schedule seven, but it seemed as if she wanted to have as few as possible! The debates are as follows:

* 10/30 in St Cloud @ the Rivers Edge Convention Center from 12:30-1:30. Public is welcome!
* 11/1 on MPR
* 11/4 on KSTP-TV Twin Cities

262,IAmA,I am a corporate/commercial pilot; AMA!,"Yea, let me start this off by most likely crushing a few people's expectations of what this will be. I'm a commercial pilot by the aviation definition of the word. I get monetarily compensated to fly. However, I'm a corporate pilot. So right there, I'll probably lose the interest of a few readers, and possibly pick up that of a few others.

I fly planes for an energy company here in the US. I'm also pretty young (mid twenties). I'm extremely lucky to be in what I consider a once-in-a-lifetime gig. I fly when I want, where I want, often for a few days at a time, and since I work in the business side of the company, I'm not just chauffeuring; I get to stay and play.

For now, I fly a single engine aircraft and a multi-engine turboprop. These are *not* jet aircraft. I have friends in the airlines who could maybe do an AMA for something concerning the 'big boy planes' or even corporate jets. For me, the jet flying won't be until next year, when the company buys one (or two? Hey boss?).

But hey, I'm definitely not opposed to a carrier commercial guy jumping in to hijack any questions that have to do with that side of the biz! In fact, I'd like it if a few of those guys did, as this will be more entertaining and educational all around. Also, I was never in the military. I went the civvy route. Military guys, you should jump in for some of those questions, too.

I'll answer what I can for as long as possible tonight. I won't give out any personal info, but I'll give my opinions and honest answers on anything pertaining to my corner of the wide, wide, world of aviation. Ask away, all.

Edit 2: Ok, I'm tired. Thank you guys and gals for the questions, I hope it was beneficial to a few people. I'm glad it worked out so well.

At about the age of 17 (in the year 2006) my father was in trouble and being sent to labour camp. I and mother and my younger sister flee to China by passing the North Korea-China border. We were then ""bought"" by 3 Chinese men and became their wives. I married to a Chinese man in the rural area of Shandong. He was 20 years older than me. I got a temporary right of residence after about a year.

I give birth to a son in the second year of marriage. My husband died last year. I then left our son to his family and went to the city nearby. Shortly after I leaved China to Macau and now working in a night club in Macau.

A month ago I have sumbit an AMA here and I still receiving various question.  It seen that many people are interested in North Korea and may be also China.  So here is the AMA again.

270,IAmA,"I was a machine gunner during a major Iraq war battle that was blacked out by the media, now we're struggling to get the story to the public AMA","I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I tested out of high school and joined the Army when I was 17. Two years later I was a machine gun team leader in an urban assault Stryker unit known as ""Bull Company."" We served a 15 month deployment from Aug 2007 to Nov 2008 as the only conventional task force running kill-or-capture raids in a district of Baghdad known as Sadr City. Our mission was to hunt down high value targets in the Mahdi Army and secure the north western flank of Sadr City from their influence.

On the 23rd of March one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the war broke out right there in Sadr City. The Mahdi Army rose up to overthrow the occupation. Our rules of engagement were lifted, and both sides went to town. Open street fighting lasted for nearly three months. Thousands of people were killed and wounded. That includes some two-hundred Americans and countless civilians - and it barely made a headline back here in the west.

At that point Iraq was considered ""old news"" and the politicians didn't want to talk about the war. 2008 was an election year so the ratings were more important than the truth. Both sides had something to lose if any word of battle made it home. The most attention it got back here was a 60 Minutes segment about high-tech UAV's - one which completely overlooked the actual fight. Other than that, were just a few back-page articles that never made it into print, and blog posts later on down the road as it solidified into a niche subject.

Instead, the biggest headlines that spring were the impending Twilight sequel, American Idol hiring a new judge, and Elliot Spitzer getting caught with a prostitute.

I recently wrote a book about my experience during the battle, and I've teamed up with some other vetsto get their stories out to the public. Together we're trying to raise awareness for what happened and some of my friends said an IAMA might help. While it would be totally cool if you want to head over to Kickstarter and pre-order a copy of the book, I'm not here to pull a Woody Harrelson. I just want to get the word out about what happened in Sadr City, help people get a more complete picture of what really happens ""on the ground"" during modern combat, and answer any questions you may have about... well... anything at all.

* The National Security Space Office, where I lead teams designing “generation after next” national security space capabilities
* The Defense Intelligence Agency (the CIA for the armed forces), where I was Senior Technical Officer for the Future’s Division, and then later on I became Chief of the Space Division
* The DIA’s lead for the national space policy and strategy development

In college, I earned my degree in East Asian Studies, and my first published book was [Chinese Intelligence Operations](http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Intelligence-Operations-ebook/dp/B004OL2NI8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346781552&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=chinese+intelligence), where I explored the structure, operations, and methodology of Chinese intelligence services.  This book earned me a declaration from the Chinese government as an “Enemy of the People.”

In 2001, I founded a non-profit educational after school program called the [Federation of Galaxy Explorers](http://www.foge.org/) with the mission of inspiring youth to take an interest in science and engineering.

AMA ","I'l be answering questions for my dad, who was a Soviet Army Sergeant stationed in a Siberian Prison Camp from '71-'73. He was called upon to do recon in Afghanistan due to his ability to speak Farsi, prior to the Soviet invasion in '79. Thanks to a tip from a Captain who was a friend of his, he avoided going to Afghanistan as those who went never returned (this was before the actual Soviet heavy weapon invasion/assault). 

He used his negative standing with the Soviet party as reason to approach the US Embassy in Moscow in 1989 and our family was granted asylum as political refugees. 

We moved to Los Angeles in 1989 (I was 2 years old).

my history in a nutshell: i'm from estonia, where i studied physics, spent a decade [developing computer games](http://www.bluemoon.ee/history/index.html) (hope the ancient server can cope!), participated in the development of kazaa and skype, figured out that to further [maximise my causal impact](http://youtu.be/84G6An1Ff2E) i should join the few good people who are trying to reduce [existential risks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk), and ended up co-founding CSER and metamed.

as a fun side effect of my obsession with causal impact, i have had the privilege of talking to philosophers in the last couple of years (as all important topics seem to bottom out in philosophy!) about things like decision theory and [metaphysics](http://youtu.be/29AgSo6KOtI?hd=1)."

288,IAmA,IAMA Holocaust survivor who immigrated to the US in 1951 with my husband and twin daughters.  AMA.,"I am sitting with my 89-year-old grandmother who is always looking for a new audience.  she has a spectacularly clear memory and important stories to tell.  Here is her brief self-introduction:

I was born in Tluste, Poland (which is now the Ukraine) in 1923.  I was 16 when the war started and the Soviet Union occupied my town.  I survived the subsequent Nazi occupation and lived in a displaced person's camp after the liberation.  You can find some information about my family and town [here](http://www.tovste.info/Spitzer_story.php), and verification [here](http://imgur.com/HWqmE).

Please ask me questions!


**Edit:**  Thank you so much for the wonderful response.  I wish we could answer all of your questions.  We might try to answer more tomorrow or do this again.  My grandmother is an amazing woman and has a mission to share her stories with as many people as she can.  


**Edit:** I am her granddaughter (ssu22) and will join in with my perspective and hopefully come back tomorrow to answer some more questions with her."
289,IAmA,"IamAn Aussie girl that grew up in the bush living in a shed contending with no electricity, bucket showers, cooking on a fire, homework by candlelight and liked to think of myself as a young herpatologist. AMA!","I was born in Sydney to parents that had grown up there and decided they wanted a rural upbringing for me and my soon to be brother. Plans were made and at 8 years old we (4 yr old bro and parents) were moving into an old, weather board tool shed (5 x 10ms) on 22 acres of land with no electricity or town water supply access in central Victoria.


The old tool shed was a temporary situation whilst my dad extended an old tin garage that was also on the property so we had more room to live in whilst he built us another house. The dream was a mud brick, A frame house, completely self sustaining. 


As life happens nothing went to plan but we had an amazing and unique experience that I'm willing to share if you are interested! To give you an idea of the unique daily/ weekly life activities/ chores/ worries I have made a list:
* Not having electricity we would have to ensure we always had huge supplies of candles lying around. We were very poor so 'just popping into town' almost 20 kms away was not always an option. We learnt the hard way early on, short Winter days became even shorter and bedtime was about 5pm.


*This was early 00's and Australia was just starting its 10 year drought so rain water that we caught in the tank was for drinking only. Shower water was supplied from one of our dams through a diesel generator. The water was so brown from the clay bottom that if you had a bath you couldn't see your hand 2cm under the surface. Best memory of going to my Nana's house back in Sydney was sitting in a crystal clear water and being able to see the bottom of the bath ( also pee).


*Snakes were a frequent occurrence, Red belly blacks  and Eastern Browns.  Dad was a real bushie and taught us how to handle situations with them. Feeling like an expert on herps I would go to a log on the property border  that had baby brown snakes every year and herd them into old lemonade bottles so my brother and I could examine them. 'Yep, that is indeed a juvenile Eastern brown that would most definitely inflict a lethal bite to a young child more than an hour from the nearest hospital'. ( Probably would have made it to the hospital but the embelishment sounds better.) 


*Being the only two black kids ( my brother and I are half white aussie and half Torres Strait Islanders) at a school in a tiny town that lived in the bush with no electricity, we aroused a lot of attention from the towns folk. My favourite question from a fellow 8 year old peer whilst looking confusedly at the palm of my hands, 'Are your hands worn out from working the land?'


*At the time it was a little weird for us to live so differently from the other kids so bringing them back for our birthdays we would be a little shy/ embarrassed, especially if they wanted a shower…
*As cooking was done on an open fire for the first 8 months of living there, chopping loads of wood was a weekly chore we all shared. I was the most ripped 8 year old child at my school, full 6 pack and guns that went on for days. To collect the wood my brother and I would drive ( I learnt to drive manual at 8 and my bro at 5) into the bush and collect the old logs lying around and bring them back to be chopped up. This is how my bro totalled our car, the only access we had to town for a few weeks before we could rustle up enough cash for a cheap Camera (bogan spec car).


*The whole thing lasted from about 8 to 15 for me as my mum had been battling schizophrenia since I was 1 week old. The episodes would become more severe and last longer every year. By the time I was 14 my parents had to separate because mum was off chops and dad was hitting the bongs hard for several years by then, needless to say the house construction was put on indefinite hold when the bongs were on the scene and mum thought I was the spawn of Satan. 


Poverty and craziness aside,  I’m so thankful to have had the experiences I had from growing up in the bush and being exposed to such a unique experience. I feel a resilience in my character now that I don’t think I would have had I grown up in a more normal setting.


My story has so much more to it so if you’re interested, ask away! 

Gosh. Proof that I lived in a shed with no electricity is super hard. Hopefully this photo of my family in hillbilly clothing in front of the foundations of our dream house will suffice? 

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/jgKcJlE.jpg?1[/IMG] 

TL;DR Bushlife. Grew up with no power or clean water with a schizophenic mum that thought I was the spawn of Satan and a hippie Dad that loved the green. Time of my life. Many stories along the way, many good, some sad and some funny brother sabo. AMA!

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the interest in my life story! I have tried to get through as many questions as I could tonight but alas it is 6am and I have an 8 am lecture that I should attend.

296,IAmA,"IAma former employee of a jail where I watched inmates be beat senseless on an almost daily basis for 3 years. I reported the beatings and was fired for it, I have spent the last few years testifying for former inmates and families of inmates who were beaten or killed in the jail. AMA","I saw horrific beatings happen almost every day. I saw inmates being beat senseless for not moving fast enough. I saw inmates urinate on themselves because they had been chained up for hours and officers refused to let them use the bathroom. This didn't happen because they were busy, this happened because it was fun. I saw an old man be beat bad enough to be taken to the hospital because he didn't respond to a verbal order RIGHT AFTER he took out his hearing aids (which he was ordered to do.) 

I was fired after I caught the beating of a triple amputee (you read that right!) on video, and I got 7 officers fired for brutality. 

Don't believe me? here's a still from the video.

This is one second of over 14 minutes of this poor man being beaten with a mop handle, kicked, punched and thrown around. As you can see in the video, he is down in the left hand corner, naked and cowerig while being sprayed with pepper spray.http://imgur.com/I8eeq

After I was fired, I sued the Sheriff's Office and the Board of County Commissioners and I settled the night before trial. I consider every penny that I got blood money, but I did get a letter of recommendation hand signed by ther sheriff himself, and I FLAT OUT REFUSED to sign a non-disclosure agreement. One of my biggest regrets in life is not taking that case to trial, but I just emotionally couldn't do it. I also regret not going to the press immediately with what I had as it happened. I want someone to finally listen about what goes on in that jail. Instead of going to the press, I decided to speak with attorneys and help inmates who were beaten and murdered by detention officers in the jail. 

In the last 5 years I have been deposed twice and I have been flown across the planet 3 times to be deposed or to testify in cases against the Sheriff. I have also been consulted by 4 or 5 other attorneys with cases against the Sherfiff. Every single time my name has been brought up (with 1 exception) the case has settled within a few months at the most. The record is 2 weeks. Some of those have gag orders on them or are sealed, so I can't discuss the ones that are under an order like that, but not all of them are like that.

Let's talk about the two most recent cases I have been involved in: 

Christopher Beckman was an inmate. He was brought in on a DUI or something like that, he wasn't a career criminal, he was a guy like you, or your buddy, or your dad who fucked up and did something stupid while drunk. He had a seizure in the jail because he was epileptic and didn't get his medications. During this seizure he was hog tied, and ran HEAD FIRST into a 2"" thick steel door, concrete walls and elevator doors. His skull was crushed and he died a few days later. I was deposed in his case and very soon afterward the family settled for an ""undisclosed"" amount of money other than the 1mil, and I promise you this..... they didn't get enough. The officers that did that to them? One of them pled out for a year in jail, the other got nothing. http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=14&amp;articleid=20110606_12_0_OLHMIY608751

Dionne McKinney: She is the toughest woman on this planet. She fought for 9 and 1/2 years to take the sheriff to trial and she did it. NO ONE takes the Sheriff to trial in OK county and wins. It hasn't happened in a civil case since the 1970's (from what I understand) She was brutally beaten in the Jail in May of 2003. I testified in this case earlier this month.http://newsok.com/jury-finds-in-favor-of-woman-who-says-oklahoma-county-jail-detention-officers-assaulted-her-nearly-10-years-ago/article/3738355

Why do I live so far away? I fear for my life. I left oklahoma in march of 2010 after I turned over every piece of evidence that I had to the feds. When I have been flown in, I have been in and out in 2 days for depositions, but for the trial, I had to be there for almost a week. I spent 4 days barricaded in my best friends' house. When I left my family in OK after testifying a few weeks ago, I knew that I'd never be able to see them in Oklahoma again and flights to me are not cheap. 
Here is an absolutely scathing report from the department of justice about the Oklahoma County Jail in 2008.
http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/OKCounty_Jail_findlet_073108.pdf


TL:DR I worked in a jail where I saw human beings being treated like dogs every day, I tried to stop it, but was fired for it and have spent the last few years being deposed and testifying about the atrocities that I witnessed.

*EDIT*: I had no idea this would get any attention, holy crap. I've been here answering your many wonderful questions for the better part of the last 11 hours and I really must get some sleep. I will answer any new questions when I get up in a few hours! Thank you so much!

*EDIT 2*: I feel that I should address this here: this is a PRE-TRIAL facility. These are not hardened criminals who have already been charged and convicted. These are people who are JUST coming into jail, still in their street clothes. Just pointing that out.

**To those of you who have been saying that what happened was a long time ago, and it couldn't possibly be happening there now** I know that what I witnessed happened back in 2001-04. I can't say for sure that things are basically the same way it has always been, but the news articles tend to agree with my opinion, which was based on what I witnessed from 2001-2004 ...

297,IAmA,[Meta] Ask Us Anything about yesterday's Morgan Freeman AMA and how we interact with celebrity AMAs,"I understand everyone is disappointed and upset at how the Morgan Freeman AMA went last night. We are too. We'd like to share with you everything we know and answer any questions about how we work with celebrities etc for AMAs. In regards to the Morgan Freeman AMA and celeb AMAs in general:  

* This was set up by the publicity team from the film studio for Oblivion. I interacted with them over the past few weeks to set this up. This is not uncommon for celebrity AMAs. Though it is not uncommon for an assistant or someone else to read the questions and type answers for a celebrity, we would never encourage or facilitate an AMA if we thought that someone was pretending to be someone. That system has worked pretty darn well.  

* We were told Morgan Freeman would be answering the questions for the AMA himself (with someone in the room typing what he said) and we believe this to be the case. If we find out otherwise we will let the community know and this would be a HUGE violation of our trust as well as yours. It's hard to imagine that a pr professional would go to such lengths to pretend to be their client in a public forum, but it's not impossible.  

* Most but not all of the bigger celebrity AMAs start with a publicist or assistant contacting us to get instructions, tips, etc. We send them a brief overview, the link to the step-by-step guide in the wiki, and sometimes examples of good AMAs by other celebrities. We also often walk through the process on the phone with the publicist/assistant, or sometimes even the celebrity themselves.  

* We do not get paid by anyone for AMAs.  

* We very often get approached by celebrities who only want to spend 20 or 30 min on an AMA or do nothing but talk about their project. We try to educate them on why an hour is the absolute minimum time commitment, and heavily discourage them from doing anything if they can not commit that much time.  

* On occasion we have ""verified"" to the mods that a user is who they claim to be. We usually do this just to let the mods know in advance what the username will be so they can prevent fakes. This is not usually an issue since we advise everyone to tweet or post a picture as proof. We won't do this anymore in the future and there should be public proof at the start of an AMA.  

* The mods here do an amazing job, and this incident was our fault, not theirs.
  
We will try to answer all the questions we can, but don't have much more information about the Morgan Freeman AMA, and are waiting to hear back from his publicity team. 

**Update**: *I have spoken to Mr. Freeman's/Oblivion's PR team and they have stated in no uncertain terms that all of the answers in the AMA were his words, and that the picture was legitimate and not doctored.*"
298,IAmA,"IamA Guy who quit his job, sold his car, moved out and bought a one-way ticket to Africa. I spent the next year and a half traveling across the entire continent, mostly overland and solo. AMA!","**Edit:** Alright everyone, thanks so much for the questions, comments and kind words, the responce to this has been truly overwhelming and amazing. I've been answering questions for about 6 hours almost non-stop now, but it's 1:30am and I need to get some sleep. I'll return and continue answering questions tomorrow because there are still a lot of good ones I have not gotten to yet. Thanks again, goodnight!

Hi everyone!

First, here is a short photo album of my journey: [Across Africa in a Year and a Half (2012-2013)](http://imgur.com/a/TiQ48)

On December 28th of 2011, I set out on a one-way flight to Cape Town, South Africa, not knowing what I was doing or when I'd return home.  I ended up spent the next year and a half traveling the entire length of the continent, all the way to Alexandria, Egypt and finally returning home to Seattle on July 3rd, of 2013.  

Here is a very rough outline of the journey: I started in South Africa, planning to drive to Cairo with two South African guys. We made it through Mozambique, Malawi and into Tanzania, staying at backpackers and doing a bit of scuba diving before that trip fell apart due to not getting along. I flew back to Cape Town alone, went to AfrikaBurn, spent a month+ on a farm, then on the coast. From there I crossed into Botswana, where I spent a month with a British guy I met through Couchsurfing, then rode a single speed bike 1,500km across the country. In the Okavango delta I met a German guy who drove down Africa in a 74 VW, and we spent the next two months together, a month of that at an orphanage in Southern Zambia. We split up, I rode my bike another 900km through Zambia then tried to paddle the worlds longest lake alone in a traditional wooden boat. It did not go well, but was an amazing experience. I took a 100 year old ex-German warship the rest of the way up the lake, then rode buses and Couchsurfed my way through Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and into Kenya. Unable to get a visa for overland entrance into Ethiopia, I flew from Nairobi, and spent an interesting but somewhat difficult month in Ethiopia. I was also unable to get a visa into Sudan and had to fly over it, one of the biggest disappointments of the trip. I arrived in Egypt, traveled the country by train and bus from one end to the other, leaving just two weeks before they threw out their president.

**Some highlights:** Simply saying 'yes' to the journey in the first place, scuba diving in Zanzibar, doing a safari in the Serengeti, going to AfrikaBurn, cycling across Botswana, paddling Lake Tanganyika, hiking in the Simian Mountains of Ethiopia and finally reaching Egypt, accomplishing my goal of crossing Africa and most importantly the people I met on the way.

**Some lowlights:** The initial 4x4 across Africa trip failing, having most of my possessions stolen in Zambia, laying semi-conscious and shitting blood for 3 days in Tanzania, and saying goodbye to a place I love.

**Death:**  I've been in villages when there have been children killed by lions and crocs, where thieves were stoned to death by a group of students, where a man was stabbed to death in a goat raid, heard stories of cerebral malaria killing in only three days, a shooting rampage in Ethiopia and saw the aftermath of a minibus crash that killed all 13 on board.  Life is cheap.  

**I never thought I would:** Travel up Africa in the first place, sit on a crocodile, go three weeks without seeing another white person, eat elephant meat, do the dressing on a fresh male circumcision, cycle the Trans-Kalahari, and be an honored guest of local headmen.

**Internationalism:**  I would find myself at parties with as many as 10 different nationalities.  Mostly through Couchsurfing, I stayed with people from South Africa, England, America, France, Spain, Russia, Sudan, India, Ethiopia, Egypt, Uganda, Tanzania, Italy, Slovakia, Germany, Botswana, Kenya and more.  

**Transportation:** I used just about every method possible.  Driving in a 4x4, taking buses, hitch hiking, riding trains, bicycles, canoes, motor boats, donkey carts, airplanes, sailboats, motorcycles, walking and more.

**Accomidations:**  Everything from mud and grass huts to 4-star condos.  I found myself sleeping in logging camps, I've slept on bags of fish while on a boat, countless random couches, laying in the sand of the Kalahari, the homes of cattle ranchers and the homes of many, many Peace Corps volunteers.  

**Overall:**  Africa is amazingly safe, expect for when it's not! Most people love America (although don't understand it at all).  My experience with Africans was overwhelmingly positive, the hospitality was simply incredible.  Africa is undergoing some extremely rapid change, and those growing pains will have major consequences and last well into the future.

301,IAmA,"I was blinded and severely mauled by a grizzly bear and barely lived to tell about it. I've adjusted to blind life and gone on to earn my masters, marry the love of my life, write a book, raise two kids, and land my dream job. -AMA","Hi everyone,
My name is Dan Bigley.  In 2003 after a stellar day of salmon fishing in Alaska, the last thing I ever saw was the grizzly bear that took my eyes.

Just the previous night I'd begun a relationship with an amazing woman who would later become my wife and mother of my two children.  Ask me anything about the bear mauling, my immediate recovery and learning I had been blinded, earning my masters degree and learning to live as a blind man, writing the book ['Beyond the Bear'](http://beyondthebear.com), technologies for the blind, fishing in Alaska, my professional career with troubled children, my love story with my wife or about being a blind father.

I work as an Assistant Location Manager for TV and films that shoot in New Mexico.

I was the location scout for the pilot, season 4 and season 5 of *Breaking Bad*.

The responsibilies of the location department include:  Scouting and finding options for shooting locations; bringing the director and producers to each option and signing up the ones that they like;  notifying neighbors, signing up base camps, and obtaining appropriate permits for shooting;  arranging street closures and help from local police and fire departments; preparing the sets for shooting and standing by on set to be the liaison for the movie to the property owners; and drawing maps and hanging directional signs to get the crew to set.

305,IAmA,I grew up in the cyberpunk-esque dystopia called Kowloon Walled City which inspired the setting in Ghost in the Shell. AMA.,"The famed (notorious) Kowloon Walled City (KWC) was brought up in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/13kdo2/hong_kong_looks_like_the_future_rcyberpunk/) thread. If you don't know what KWC is, here are moe infos (mostly culled from the same thread, so credit to the posters there), but basically it looked like [this](http://www.doobybrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/kowloon-walled-city-whole.jpg):

(1) [The City of Darkness](http://www.doobybrain.com/2007/08/22/kowloon-walled-city-city-of-darkness/)

(2) [99% invisble article](http://99percentinvisible.org/)

(4) [German Documentary from 1989](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lby9P3ms11w&amp;feature=bf_prev&amp;list=PL02C43907873AB3CC)

I lived in KWC when I was 2-3 years old but I have no recollection of that time. Later on, even though our family moved out of there, but since I was enrolled in the schools near there and my parent worked during the day, so my bro and me were dropped off at my relative's place in KWC everyday. I got to know the place pretty well because I spent at least 4 hrs there everyday from 1984 to 1991. So ask away!

Note: I will be back in a few hours to start answering questions, got shit to do today.
 
Edits:

(1) I know a lot of you want proof. I can think of two things that may prove it, my school photo from Bishop Ford's memorial school and Angel's Kindergarten which are both next to KWC and I think both still exit. I will see if i can find them and send it to the Mod when i get home.

(2) Many of you asked for pictures inside. Even though everyone has a camera now, back in the 80s it was not that common and even if our family had one, it made no sense to waste the film inside KWC from the people who lives there perspective.

(3) Bishop Ford's memorial School is on top of a hill next to KWC and it's next to a cementery. Even most Hong Kong people don't know this fact unless you are a Kowloon or Lok Fu local!!! People from Lok Fu can back me up on this. I guess this is like a semi-proof that at least I am local to that area.

(4) I need to go now but will be back and answer a few more and hopefully find my photos and send to the mod as proof. Thanks for the interest in this AMA!

Edit 2:

(1) I just sent some strong circumstantial proof to the mod because as I said I don't have direct proof. 

(2) My answers are vague? Yea true, but I am recalling things that happened 20 or more years ago and I was about 8-10 years old at that time, how can I comment on the nuances of the socio-political situations there from the memories of a child?

(3) I am not familiar with every single place in KWC?  This is true, now just look at the photos and tell me, would you let your 8-10 years to roam the dirty alleys inside KWC?? I mostly travelled back and forth from my relative's place and school and when my bro, cousins and me went out and played, we played OUTSIDE the fortress. Kids don't play hide and seek inside KWC. 

Edit 3:

(1) The mod hasn't got back to me about the proof I sent, probably because it's thanksgiving.

(2) Lack of photos inside? I am repeating myself here, it was in the 80s, I didn't have an iphone back then, I could't just take random snap shots of the place. Do you notice that all the photos of KWC are from journalists or professional photographers and not from residents who took photos of themselves inside? It never came to mind back then that I should take a photo of myself in the dark alley under the leaking pipes with all the shits and trash on the ground.

(3) I will probably pop back in tomorrow to answer a few more questions.

Edit 4:

(1) [Here is the google map of Bishop Memorial School](http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&amp;q=Bishop+Ford+Memorial+School,+Kowloon+,+Hong+kong&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=38897761&amp;biw=1191&amp;bih=624&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl), you can see the Kowloon Walled city park just next to it.

(2) I will probably look at this thread again for the last time tonite and answer a few more questions and maybe do a summary.

Final Thoughts:

Well I think I will leave this AmA now. By some requests, [here](http://i.imgur.com/hfARp.jpg) is the photo of KWC where I indicate (red arrow) approximately the building I spent most of my time in, it is only approximate since there was no way I could know what the building looked like from the outside and I locate it by approximating the way I took to get there. The yellow arrow indicate the Kindergarten I went to and the blue arrow points to the location of the Bishop Ford Memorial school. Where did most of the residents go? The buildings pointed by the purple arrow and many more behind them not shown in this photo were the destinations  of many of the residents.

There is some misconception about KWC, by the mid-80s, it was no longer as dangerous as it once was. There were probably still many drug problems/prostitution/gangs and triads, but they have all gone underground. On the surface, at least from what I remember, it was a very busy place where people carried on with their lives just like any other places. 

Many people asked about fire hazard, I had seen a few fires broke out throughout the years, but they were always isolated to a few apartments. There was never a really big scale fire that I remember, probably due to the all concrete buildings and high humidities within the fortress, but honestly I don't know why it never happened (thankfully)."

313,IAmA,"I homeschool my children.  I didn't think this was considered unusual or negative, but mentioning it elsewhere on Reddit has shown me there is a lot of misinformation and hostility toward it.  So, I invite you to AMA.","I am a former public school teacher and I now homeschool my daughter (13, 8th grade) and my son (5, kindergarten). This is our third year. 

I homeschool because I want my kids to have an experience-based education. We use textbooks for things like math, science, and history. Both of my kids are avid readers, writers, and artists. I teach writing using my own curriculum to my own children as well various groups of kids for pay (which is how I fund our travel). I send them out for music, art, and PE classes, as well as science lab classes. But the basis of their education is in experience, and we spend a lot of time outside, in museums, speaking with experts, and exploring places away from home. This year, we've been all over, including places within our our state, as well as across the country and overseas. I'll link to two of my Facebook albums, if that's allowed, to show you some of what we've seen and done...the first one is from our Oregon trip, where we spent a month, including a week on the road studying geology, and the second is from our Virgin Islands trip, where we lived in an eco-camp that runs on renewable resources and where we worked with scientists and studied the coral reef. My daughter is still participating in an ongoing public outreach project to educate people on the reefs and their importance.

EDIT:  Removed albums because of morons.  

I think that's enough fodder to open with. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer! I think there are a lot of myths out there about homeschooling, especially about socialization, and I would love to dispel some of them. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention that we do not homeschool for religious reasons. I am an atheist, my husband is a Muslim (pretty much only culturally, though I think he does believe in God), and my kids are free to decide for themselves.

EDIT again: This is exploding, and I don't think I can possibly get to all your questions! I'll write a little more on the most popular areas, so that maybe some questions will be answered up-front.

Socialization:
My kids do something with other children every single day. The have art class, gym class, music class, books clubs, literature circles, various co-ops, and one-off special event type things regularly. Parents organize gatherings of kids similar in age on a regular basis. We belong to a community of homeschoolers that is made up of over 150 families in our area. Three hundred children in these families participate in various activities offered by the group. All kinds of kids, all different ages, with all sorts of personalities and abilities/disabilities. There are some they love, and some they don't like, and they deal with it all effectively.

Sheltering:
Both of my children are away from me quite often. I do not shelter or smother them. They learn from other people, and they have their own interests that I'm not necessarily a part of. Hell, I hardly ever see my daughter on the weekends. I'm sure she'll have plenty of opportunity to get into the usual trouble and make her way out of it...hopefully not at 13, but I have no illusions about what's coming up in the next few years. 

Money:
The way we homeschool is kind of expensive, with all of the travel and whatnot. The money I earn working at my part-time tutoring business goes directly toward their educations. We are not wealthy, but we find ways to do what we want to do. It does not have to be expensive though, so to those of you who stated you are considering homeschooling, please don't factor that into your decision. 

Religious vs. non-religious homeschoolers:
We are secular, as I stated above. I know no homeschooler personally who is a fundamental religious homeschooler, though I know they do exist, and did exist in much greater numbers in the past. The demographics of homeschooling are changing drastically, and I think it's important for us all to note. I believe that keeping your child at home to seclude them and indoctrinate them into anything is flat-out abuse. I hate that what I do is mixed up with this other kind of homeschooling, and that's why I decided to do this AMA...to give another viewpoint. 

I'll be answering more questions later, but my fingers need a break right now. Thanks for all of your responses!

An estimated 500,000 people use Tor on a daily basis; some use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, some use Tor to research sensitive topics, and some use Tor to connect to news sites and instant messaging services when these are blocked by their local Internet providers.

Karen Reilly (puffin_net) is the Development Director at The Tor Project, responsible for fundraising, advocacy, general marketing, and policy outreach programs for Tor.

Runa A. Sandvik (runasand) is a developer and researcher working on a range of different projects, from blocking analysis and quality assurance, to outreach and support.

For the last six years, I've been traveling to Helmand, Afghanistan's most violent province. I've seen huge loss of life and limb there- and destruction of property. Most of the country has now been handed over to the Afghan security forces, which is supposed to be progress. Some officials even claim it is victory. I was with those security forces last November and December, and the chaos and corruption I saw was deeply shocking. 

I can't avoid thinking that we aren't leaving because we have achieved our goals, we are leaving because we've given up on them.

329,IAmA,"IAMA daughter of parents who lived through the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia until its fall. I am with my mom here who will answer any questions at all! She lost her parents and many of her siblings, fought off soldiers, joined a resistance to escape a forced marriage, and so much more.","Hi everyone,

I am currently sitting here with my mom who is willing to answer any questions related to her life in Cambodia, her experience through the regime and war (where over 1.3 million Cambodians died), and her arrival in Canada in '83.

She was around 11 when they chased everyone from the city and made them march on foot to labour camps. There is so much of her experience I haven't heard yet, so this will also be somewhat of a new thing for me.

[This is her and my dad when they first met at a refugee camp in Thailand.](http://i.imgur.com/q5MHC.jpg)

-------------------------

One of the reasons why I decided to start this AMA is to raise funds for a personal cause.

My mom lost her parents during the time they made everyone work on the farm in villages. When the regime fell, one of her uncles went from villages to villages in search of my mother and surviving children of the family. He then took them all in and raised them as his own, not only because he had unconditional love for them, but also in memory of his brother (my grandfather) who had always supported him to make sure he had a good life while they were growing up.

She left Cambodia in 1983 and never had the chance to return. My parents and I grew up in a low income household before I started workig.

We recently got news this month that he was diagnosed with lung cancer and is already at the terminal phase, leaving him with less than 3 months to live.

What I'm trying to do is basically raise enough money so my mom can go to Cambodia (she doesn't know this yet!) to meet her uncle, whom she actually calls her adoptive father, before it's too late. One of my regrets in life was not being able to help my dad go to Cambodia when his parents passed away when I first started working. It was devastating to him and extremely heartbreaking to me.

TL;DR: My mom's uncle raised her when she lost her parents. She hasn't seen him in over 28 years and now he has 3 months to live. So I'm trying to raise money by doing this AMA. She's not aware of it, it's a surprise!

For more details, I invite you to visit my fundraiser page: http://www.indiegogo.com/khmer-daughter

I'll try to get to as many as I can, though, so long as he stays interested. Keep in mind that some things may be lost due to my imperfect translation, but I'll be as faithful as I can.

A gold star would be nice for this, but all the corroborating documents are out of reach and in Russian, so that might prove difficult. I have a few news articles in the house somewhere that mention him; I'll try to scan them in. Here are a few [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/nu7wO) of him I put up yesterday (B&amp;W are old, color ones are from the previous month).

Oh, and also, no debates/insults please. I'll refuse to translate those. And if anything in here seems particularly aggrandizing, it's my fault, as I respect, admire, and love the man greatly.

So, without further ado, begin!/

/edit:ps. when it's me, the grandson, speaking, I'll couch my words in slashes. When it's him, I won't/

/edit2: Okay, I've done about a dozen questions so far and need to do some yard work right now, but I'll be back to do more (the ""best"" first and then the bottom page ones after) in a bit. He's enjoying it so far, but each question takes me a good 10-15 minutes to get through because he's very fond of telling lengthy stories on not too pertinent asides/

/edit: I'm answering a few questions I personally know the answers to and will resume when we finish with our runs with the dogs. I also gave some soft evidence in favor of this thread's legitimacy here. (Ha, and I've also just realized that his book has tons of pictures of him working on rockets or in space suits or with recognizable Russian officials. Should have just posted that to begin with): http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/etu2s/i_was_born_in_shchigry_ru_in_1932_i_worked_as_a/c1awfsl

/edit: ok, we just got back, I'll do the top 8-12 questions right now but then he has to go to bed. He falls asleep at 20:00ish and wakes up at 4:30 for exercise and assorted housework. After these I'll only be continuing sometime tomorrow.

/edit: Ok, done for tonight, he's long asleep now. Oh, and while taking pictures from his book to help answer the question pertaining to the mission to mars, I snapped a shot of a picture of him standing in a group picture with a bunch of other important people (I think some guys from nasa are in there too). He's the guy above his finger in the big white suit. :] http://i.imgur.com/jRioO.jpg

Oh, and we haven't answered too many questions so far, but some of the ones we have are buried because of higher voted comments getting in there first. Please keep that in mind./

/edit: Ok, new day, but we have a few things to do and won't get to anything before the afternoon. We'll be continuing on for sure though! And the user L33tphreak found the article from above online, if anyone wants to read it: http://goo.gl/lsXkS Google translate sort of butchers the text though./

/edit: Ok, so I tried asking some more questions but we got stuck on the first one, which asked for examples of trolling, and I've put them all here: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/etu2s/i_was_born_in_shchigry_ru_in_1932_i_worked_as_a/c1awh46

/hey guys, sorry for being so bad in answering questions to this thing, but I've been rather busy this past week and it's been difficult to coordinate with my grandpa. And today's my last day of winter break so I'll not get a chance to really answer more for a while, unless my grandpa learns to use the internet or we do it via phone.

348,IAmA,Per Request: I Was A Dildo Engineer AMA,"I spent a summer building, testing, and assisting with designs on small vibrators, AMA. By testing, I mean that I performed a number of experiments on materials, motors, and variable resistors.

349,IAmA,"I can control a robotic arm with the power of my mind. IAm Jan Scheuermann, guinea pig extraordinaire. AMA","**Proof: [Me](http://i.imgur.com/TkMCY.jpg), and [me with 60 Minutes host Scott Pelley](http://i.imgur.com/tTpBD.jpg). You can recognize me in the [UPMC video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76lIQtE8oDY) about the study, from the [UPMC Media Kit](http://upmc.com/media/media-kit/bci/Pages/default.aspx) on the brain-controlled interface, or from the promo about the piece on the study on [60 Minutes](http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50137594n&amp;tag=api), which will be premiering tonight around 7:30!** 

IAmA 53 year-old quadriplegic woman who enrolled in a study at the University of Pittsburgh medical Center (UPMC) last fall. In February, I had brain surgery to insert two sensors into the motor cortex area of my brain. One week later, I was moving a robotic arm with my thoughts. 

Since then, the research team and I have been putting Hector (the name I gave the robotic arm) through his paces. I have learned how to move him to pick up and move objects, to interact with the environment, to shake hands, to play rock paper scissors, and ultimately, to feed myself. Much has been made over the fact that I fed myself chocolate. I also fed myself string cheese and red pepper. 

This technology will advance rapidly. The possibilities are amazing. Down the road, the cables will not be necessary. Subjects will need smaller implants, and the robotic arm will be smaller and portable. Eventually, amputees will be able to move prosthetic arms with their minds. 

Before my illness, I ran Deadly Affairs, a successful Murder Mystery Party business. Spurred on by my success in the UPMC study, I finally finished editing and self-published my first book, [Sharp as a Cucumber](http://www.amazon.com/Cucumber-Brenda-LaVoom-Mystery-ebook/dp/B008OAVZQG/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top), on Amazon Kindle last July. My book is based the script of one of my most popular murder mysteries. 

I am lucky to be part of this study. I am so excited to go to the lab and try new things and achieve new goals. Being part of this project has given me a new sense of purpose and awakened me to the fact that I am more than the body I live in. I am so happy that seeing this video and the story tonight on 60 Minutes will give hope to a lot of handicapped people. It won't happen tomorrow, but hang in there! It will happen. 

I am happy to answer questions. As I cannot type, my daughter will be helping me throughout the AMA. I will be answering questions until around 6pm EST, when I will leave and go watch my 60 Minutes premiere!

353,IAmA,I did research on facial attractiveness for years at a major university and published in the field. AMA,"Update 7 PM GMT on April 23:  Thanks for all of the interest &amp; the questions (and the Gold). The conversation really went in a lot of directions &amp; it was interesting to see it unfold.

I did most of this AMA in 20 hrs straight (like a lunatic) - so my wording was not always the best &amp; there might be some unclear statements.  I've tried to make some edits to clear things up more.  In general, this topic is more complex than it might seem on the surface.  We have many different kinds of preferences and even 100 studies measuring those preferences just scratches the surface.  Also, there are rarely black &amp; white answers in this field, though we can usually spot trends. Even since the AMA, I've argued about some of the questions with people I know who have done similar research.  Plastic surgeons have huge disagreements over techniques and what is aesthetically pleasing too.  So, all of this has to be taken in that context.  There are no absolutes in this area because of subjectivity - though we can understand a great deal about the topic based on things that are repeatable in research studies (and thus, more likely to be objective).

TL;dr:  Facial attractiveness has a lot of components like symmetry, sexual dimorphism, skin quality, facial ratios, ""averageness"" (how much your features represent the average in the population - like the average length nose), and a viewer's personal preference (which can make up a large % of the equation).  So, it's complicated &amp; sometimes contradictory, as research often can be.  There are still a lot more questions than answers in the field.  At least we know some of the major components - and this info is based on empirical research in psychology, literature from plastic surgeons, and a little bit of literature from art.

359,IAmA,IAMA girl who spent roughly 16 months as a full time BDSM slave a few years ago,"**New ! I now have a blog!!!**

You will be able to follow my updates and get draft chapters of my future book at : http://rebootedgirl.wordpress.com

I also created http://www.reddit.com/r/rebootedgirl

**Introduction**

My new boyfriend has been insisting for months that I do a IAMA but I always refused because I feel that this is simply too personal. He told me that it was important I share because it could be an inspiration to others and in the end, he won. 

If you want to read it, be patient, because it’s a long one. A summary wouldn’t allow me to truly show what I went through so I decided to spell it out.

**My childhood**

I was an accident. Both my parent made that pretty clear in my mind, for almost all of my childhood and teenage years. My father was 53 when I was born and my mother 38. They had been unhappily married for 20 years and one night, my father forced himself on my mother years after she had stopped taking the pill and 9 months later, I arrived.

I grew up miserable. My father was an alcoholic. He worked as a carpenter and worked long hours outside of the house. As soon as he came home, he would start drinking and later in the evening, beat my mother for an offense or another he thinks she did to him. 

My mother on the other hand is I guess a co-alcoholic and somehow thinks that our life was normal, that every husband in the world is like my father and every wife is like her. You know women who try to pretend that their husband loves them even if he beats her? My mom’s rationalization isn’t that he still loved her but rather than love simply doesn’t exist. She was always a stay at home mom and if she left, not only would should she be alone in life but she would have no money. Needless to say, neither have any real education.

Both pretty much ignored me all my life. If my mother was hungry, she would prepare a meal for lunch when I came back from school, otherwise, I learned to fix myself a sandwich quite early. Only supper was guaranteed to be on the table because my father ate with us.

I couldn’t receive any friends, because of my father and I couldn’t visit any friends, because of their father who were just as bad as mine in my mother’s mind.

So I grew up limited only to meeting kids in school which sucks because real friends see each other outside of school.

I sucked in pretty much every subject. Not getting any help on homework and my inability to sleep until late at night because of my parent’s arguing didn't help. 

But the worse was that nothing rang a bell in my mind. It was all normal. It was life. Movies and TV showed fiction including when it involved happy families.

I began lying to friends about my family but I couldn’t realize that they were actually telling the truth. I couldn’t conceive of parents who actually loved their kids. That was on TV, with monsters and fairy tales.

**Teenager years**

Around 11 or 12, I began drinking. My father left bottles everywhere and I would take a few sips to help me calm down during the fights. I spent my evenings locked up in my room and drinking so I would try to ignore what was going on outside of my room. Like I said, I was mostly ignored. I was like a dog you had to feed. You could fight in front of it, because it couldn’t understand you.

At 12 however, you aren’t a little girl anymore. Guys started to notice me. I was usually wearing awkward clothes and no one bothered to buy me a well-fitting bra. 

I was desperate for attention and certain boys quickly discovered it. I lost my virginity at 13 to a guy who was a year or two older. 

**Drugs**

Soon, I was offered light drugs like marijuana, acid blotters and ecstasy. I didn’t need more to get in the sack with a guy so I guess that’s why I never tried cocaine or anything stronger.

Drugs helped me avoid my problems and allowed me to fly through the days either without feeling anything at all or by letting me feel things that had nothing to do with my daily life.

But more importantly, I don’t think I ever took any drugs alone. I would take them with boys who offered it to me in exchange for sex and they all thought that it was the drug I was after when I think I wanted some love and affection. The drugs were just a nice bonus.

Most of the time however, I felt depressed and a few time took a lot of pills to apparently kill myself, but in reality, I think I mostly wanted to know if people would miss me when I was gone. I don’t really want to talk about that, not even with my boyfriend in private.

**Death of my father**

When I turned 16, my dad died of rectal cancer gone general. He didn’t even realize he was sick until a few months before his death. I had known he had problems on the toilet for years but we never thought it was something that awful.

He refused all treatments and chose to simply die at our home, peacefully. In reality, he simply screamed orders at my mother all day long since he rarely left his bed. He had a colostomy and it disgusted him profoundly until he died.

For a little while, I thought it would be better with my mother now that he was gone but obviously, her problems weren’t caused entirely by him. She mourned for him for years like a normal widow, but in an excessive manner. She stopped making meals altogether but continued buying the same groceries as when we were three in the house, letting a lot of the food spoil.

**BDSM**

That’s roughly when I started dating a guy who was into BDSM. Sorry it took so long to get there.

He was one of the guys who used to give me drugs but he liked to have it a little rougher. We started visiting a local BDSM dungeon where he would tie me up and whip me or spank me.

In the beginning, I thought it was weird, but it was something to do and he really seemed to like me. Plus, I was stoned most of the time and barely felt anything.

I wouldn’t say I was his girlfriend or anything serious like that. He was just a guy I frequently saw.

**Alone in the dungeon**

But one day, the dungeon master became furious when he saw weeds and pills in my partner’s bags and expulsed and banned him, leaving me alone in the club.

I should have followed him, but I guess I was already too stoned to do so. I met a few people. I can’t say I had ever presented myself before and felt accepted by them. A few weeks later, I began returning alone, if only to feel welcomed somewhere.

I had dropped out of high school by then and didn’t know anything about anything. I couldn’t do the laundry, I couldn’t really cook, I couldn’t talk politely enough to work anywhere. I simply was a reject of society, a complete wreck.

Of course, back then, I couldn’t realize any of that. I couldn’t see that soon enough I would most likely be left alone on the streets by my mother to become either a prostitute or yet another homeless girl begging for change.

**Enter Frank**

But I met Frank (fake name). Frank was one of the masters visiting the dungeon. He was single but he wanted a full time slave girl to live with him. He gave classes on bondage and safety in BDSM and helped a lot of people, but he didn’t want a girl to play from time to time. He wanted a full time slave to keep in his loft in a committed relationship.

I think he had noticed me the first time I went to the dungeon with my ex, but perhaps he looked at all girls as possible future slaves.
All I know was that he paid a lot of attention to me when I was there alone. He did a lot of bondage demonstrations using me as a model and even practiced his suspensions on me which I kind of liked.

I had stopped seeing my ex since he had gotten banned and I was now cut off from my supply of both drugs and sex to get my mind off of my solitude.

**Accepting the proposition**

So I began to open to him and one day, after he proposed for the 40th time or so to have me as a slave full time, I simply said yes.

I didn’t know what I was getting into, but I didn’t care. I had nothing in front of me and my mother hadn’t spoken to me in weeks.

I left with him to reach his loft. It’s in an old industrial building. It’s a unit in the middle, without windows or interior walls. It only has a small kitchenette in one of the corners and a small industrial bathroom: there was a man’s restroom with a urinal and a booth for a toilet, but the toilet in the woman’s section had been replaced by a shower.

The rest of the loft was occupied mostly by home-made bondage equipment, apart for a king size bed.

He told me that he wanted a house slave. That I could leave anytime I wanted by saying my safe-word but that until then, I wouldn’t be allowed to leave his loft unless I needed to see a doctor. We went over my limits but I am not sure I was really sure of what I was getting into. I mostly checked no on his list on a few things I was scared off, stuff like branding and needles or tattoos. He did have to explain a few of them to me.
I guess today that my motivation was mostly to live somewhere with someone who would care for me and Frank was the closest I could find. We talked a lot and the next day we went to my house so I could pick up my things and say goodbye to my mother who was obviously unconcerned that I was moving away.

It’s only when we came back to his loft that I began my 16 month journey…

**My beginning as a slave**

Frank carefully helped me pack my few things in boxes for storage and in all seriousness, asked me to strip naked.

At first, I felt ashamed, but a few soothing words from Frank helped me calm down. He boxed my clothes too and I ended up not wearing anything until the day I decided it was enough, 16 months later.

Well, I did wear panties during my periods, but otherwise, I was fully naked around the clock, for more than a year.

Frank works in a factory on shifts. He sometimes works the night shift, sometimes works the day shift, etc…

One of the first things he did was get rid of all calendars and clocks in the house, keeping only his watch and his cellphone for any time references. He didn’t have a computer or a TV or even a radio so even if I wanted to know the time or the date when he was away at work, it was impossible. He didn’t even have a phone at home, using only his cellphone for communications.

At first, our relationship was like most other couples in that we engaged in conversation, had lots of sex with the added kinkiness of me being suspended or tied or even whipped from time to time.

Quickly, as time went by however, it was expected that I would behave more and more like a slave and with less and less freedom of will. He was slowly helping me let go of my resistance to obedience, as he said it.

**Getting used to it**

Gradually, I began to enjoy it. When he was there, he would train me in doing whatever he wanted me to do, including cooking, cleaning the loft or servicing him sexually. When he wasn’t there, I was left instructions on what to do, like meditation or even just stretching exercises.
Rapidly, I lost track of time and Frank insisted that this was his goal. He wanted me to fully rely on him for all information.
I realized that sometimes, a Wednesday would follow a Thursday, but I was expected to just accept it and soon enough, I stopped asking or caring about which day we were.

Today, I realize he was almost brainwashing me, but like my mother, I didn’t see any alternatives. I was warm, I was secure, I was loved and unlike her, the few times I was hit I actually welcomed and enjoyed it as it was usually followed by some of the best sex I ever had.

Several times, he invited friends over and no, I was not allowed to dress back up. Most of the people were friends I knew from the dungeon, but I was usually expected to play a certain role, like remain silent for the evening and simply serve food for everything or even just remain on all four and serve as a human footrest for the whole evening.

Only twice did someone else had sex with me, thought in one of the cases, I have no idea if it was really someone else.

**Long term roles**

You see, some of the things he did were long term rules or roles. I once did pet play for a full month (well roughly three weeks), from the end of my periods to the beginning of the next one. I played the role of the puppy night and day.

But the worst part for me to endure were the 3 weeks or so I spent blindfolded. Not once in those 3 weeks was I allowed to see anything, but I was expected to continue to follow my routine.

At first, I hit everything and I did think to cheat while he was at work, but I remained faithful and spent the whole period blindfolded. During that time, Frank received friends over and I had sex with someone but I am not sure if it wasn’t Frank himself. It sure felt familiar.
The other time was for a threesome.

Eventually, he kept pushing more and more. His little stint with the blindfold was notable one of the tipping points. For days after the removal, I was hypersensitive to light and the Chilean miner crisis recently showed me there was a real danger to his fetish. 

**Getting out**

One day, he decided to tie me to his cross like he often did and I just said my safe-word. I had enough. I had been forbidden to talk for the previous few months and I no longer felt good about myself like in the beginning. I had forgotten who I was, what I wanted and simply couldn’t take it 
anymore.

He confirmed that was what I wanted and brought me some of my clothes to put on my pale carcass. Without any sunlight in 16 months, my skin had never been so white, and I had lost quite a lot of weight under his care.
He didn’t drop me on the street like I was afraid he would do or like my mom told me men acted when you said no to them. He asked me the date I thought we were and I was off by a good 3 months, under evaluating my stay. I had just missed my second birthday while in his presence and I was now 20 years old.

I had left the dungeon that night on a hot summer day and when I came out, snow was everywhere.
We found my mother but I discovered she didn’t even care where I had been or that we hadn’t spoken for that long. The three of us ate supper without even speaking a word.

I stayed with Frank for another 5 months but I wasn’t his slave anymore. We did continue to have sex and even do a little BDSM play but we were back to the talking phase we had in the beginning. We spoke a lot about what I had gone through and I shared all my thoughts and emotions. He apologized for the last part where he asked me to stay silent for so long.

He mostly wanted to be sure he didn’t somehow break me or traumatize me.

He tried to convince me to try it again, but it was behind me now. I had others things to do even if I had no idea what.

**Finding a job and moving out**

Two months after I said my safe-word, I found a job in a burger joint, not a big chain but a mom and pop store where I was a waitress serving greasy burgers.

Three months later, Frank and I agreed it would be better if I moved so he helped me find a small apartment and even paid for the first few months to help me get on track, allowing me to find used furniture and even all of the appliances.
We stayed in touch for a while, but he was busy finding my replacement. When he did, he stopped calling me as he was now busy with his new slave. I had met her. She wanted to confirm that Frank wasn’t a psycho and I reassured her that I was fine. Frank promised he wouldn’t do the same mistakes he did with me.

**Now**

I eventually made a new boyfriend, a regular customer at my restaurant, and now I am the receptionist for the office he works for.
Somehow, what happened in those 16 months almost helped me reboot my life. I don’t think it was because of the BDSM itself, but perhaps it was simply because someone had loved me and taken care of me almost like a child for the first time in my life.

**Conclusion**

What scares me today from time to time is that if he hadn’t begun to impose long term rules like the no speaking part, I might still be there, without the attention of a dentist and slowly losing sense of who I was.

But I grew out of that and slowly defined who I was and what I wanted and didn’t want and even learned today to say no to my boyfriend, something my mother was never able to do.

**Summary**

If you didn't want to read, here is a summary:

- I was an accident and my parents ignored me all my life
- desperate for attention, I slept with boys who gave me drugs
- I eventually dated a guy who was into BDSM and when he was kicked out of the dungeon, continued going
- Frank asked me to be a full time slave at this loft and I eventually said yes
- I spent 16 months naked at his loft as a slave, slowly almost being brainwashed
- One day, I said it was enough and moved out

**UPDATE Friday Morning**


I am trying to answer the questions I didn't get. I didn't fight with my boyfriend (but he did get a BJ). Here are some of the most asked questions:

- The safeword was ""MacGyver""
- No, I no longer do BDSM
- I was with Frank from August 2002 to January 2004, so it was 7 years ago
- Since then, I returned to high school and turned my life around
- I didn't take any drugs since the night my ex was banned, so I didn't take any with Frank
- I was 18 when I said yes to Frank. Not 16 like some understood.
- the problem with Dental care is because my current boyfriend is obsessed with his teeth, but I didn't realize it was an unhealthy obsession
- Yes, I will try to write a novel about my experience"

I only came on here to share because I thought it was an interesting thing to happen to someone and I knew reddit would listen and it would help to talk about it. When I made this post, I was still in shock of the whole situation and information was given to us by different sources. I wanted to say I orginally told you guys how much the navy was giving us because thats what I understood it to be and that amount was only going to last two weeks. I will say now that has changed and the navy has given everyone a set amount of money but I won't discuss that here. Also we do have a lawyer but thats to protect us. The media on this thread is ridiculous, don't believe everything that you read please. I will say that my orginal shock of the whole situation is wearing off and reality is starting to sink in. My family and I have a lot we need to do in the next few days, weeks, and months. I will probably do a follow-up post just to let reddit know that we're okay, which I know we will be. I thank you guys for all the support, this I honestly mean that. I also need to say, yes my brother and I have recieved a lot of attention but we're not the only ones who were affected. Please keep everyone in your thoughts.

Hi my name is Devin and I'm 21 years old. I can't even begin to wrap my mind around what has happened. Who thinks they're gonna wake up one morning then have their house destroyed by a jet?? My brother was the one who saved the pilot (Colby Smith)
The amount of support I have gotten has been incredible.
I decided to turn to reddit since I knew it was such a new and weird story.
It's even crazier that no one died.
But I guess I wanted to see how many people have had anything similar....tornado, fire, etc of their house and how did you feel? When did it get better? How was it seeing your house?

EDIT: People keep saying this is a scam? I'm not asking for money but people kept asking for me to post my pay-pal so I did. My brother was at work, he's with me now, so I took a picture with him haha http://imgur.com/ZMFIt

UPDATE: We have lawyered up, thank you for all your words reddit. I'm just glad I'm here to share this story with you. Talking to you all is helping me stay sane in the moment :)

and just cause i can: here's a video! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE_Qo9FPxME&amp;feature=youtu.be , you guys needed a thank you video. I blocked the comments cause I don't need anymore trolls in my life right now, the navy did enough.

my brother's story: My brothers story is actually really cool and it gave me chills when he told me. He was playing guitar hero in his room then got up to go put his contacts in. He was standing in the bathroom when the jet hit. He said it was a loud thunder noise and huge explosion and the house started shaking and the power cut off. He popped his head out of the doorway and saw his room on fire. He ran down the stairs and out the house without shoes on. Ran to my neighbor's house and then found the pilot right beside that house. That's when the pilot said he was sorry for hitting our home and my brother told him it was alright and they needed to move him to safety. There had to be a reason he got up at that precise moment to put his contacts in, it's freaky to think what would have happened to him if he decided to play one more song....

I'm off to bed, goodnight reddit, thank you for just hearing my story and all your kind words and questions. I am beyond thankful for the people who donated. You really didn't have to and trust me it's appreciated. I'll try and keep you guys updated but my internet access is extremely limited right now.

UPDATE: the fucking hotel we were staying in kicked us out because our navy allowance hadn't come in yet. They charged us $400. i'm getiing the navy allowance today, but I am beyond hurt. I called the mayor and the local news about this but they were completely unhelpful.

We have regained everything he refused to give up on our own during that process, and can assure all current and future customers that the N-Control castle is once again impenetrable. This thread is stagnant, but I am plowing through to make sure all items raised (not duplicated necessarily) are addressed. Thank you all for participating and listening.**

UPDATE 6: I've been focusing on some very time-sensitive items elsewhere, but am still committed to answering everything here to the best of my ability before the New Year. Consider questions closed at midnight tonight US Central Time (please stop asking then so I can catch up).

UPDATE 5 (midnight Friday): Again, this store ain't closing yet. Until I say we're done, I'm still answering stuff.

UPDATE 4: Not shutting this thread down until I catch up pretty well, so keep commenting and asking. Lots to sift through here.

UPDATE 3: I'm a back guys, bear with me as I sift through.

UPDATE 2: At 9:40am CST, I've decided to take a nap. This AMA is not dead, I just haven't slept in two days. Keep commenting and questioning, and consider this thing open ~~until midnight Friday CST~~. I'm sure there are a lot more questions to be asked.

~~UPDATE: Mr. Christoforo has very recently become much more forthcoming and helpful regarding a variety of Avenger/N-Control's digital assets that we requested he return a few days ago (as mentioned below in detail). We thank him for his renewed helpfulness.~~

372,IAmA,I kick people out of my Alamo Drafthouse movie theaters without a refund for texting and talking. AMA.,"When we were 23 years old, my wife and I opened up our first single screen movie theater. We didn't have any qualifications except for one -- we were devoted movie fans. We were lucky to find that to be most important qualification of all. Since then, we have expanded to 14 locations and are building more.  

As the Alamo Drafthouse grows, we remain dedicated to keeping the movie-watching experience safe for movie fans, serving quality food and drinks, and upholding high presentation standards. We are also striving to achieve long term goals by expanding the theater to new neighborhoods. Here are the eight objectives we hope to achieve as we grow:

1. Share the movies we love with as many people as possible.
2. Be a community cultural center.
3. Build an audience for classic, golden era cinema.
4. Build an audience for foreign language films.
5. Build a youth and collegiate cinephile audience.
6. Help local video stores survive as community cultural centers.
7. Help preserve our vulnerable 35mm film history.
8. Help preserve our even more vulnerable VHS film history.

Since we are expanding to several new cities this year, I thought I would bring together a few folks from the Alamo to answer any questions you might have.

373,IAmA,"IAmA Painter &amp; Decorator sub-contracted to redecorate council houses, flats and buildings. I have seen things you would not believe. AMA.","Actually, I'm not anymore. I lost my job when my daughter was born. Took a week paternity leave and was called at the end of it by my contractor to find that I had been laid off. I was not awarded any redundancy pay because I was sub-contracting. 

I never went back to that profession and am now doing something completely different. 

However, fuck those guys - I have plenty of stories to tell and if you are the tennant of a British council house or flat or even if you are not and just have questions, ask away. I am quite happy to spill every bean I have.

If proof is needed I can scan my CIS card which has my name and face but I will only do this to the mods as I don't really want to be incriminated for bean spilling by my former employers who were, frankly, a bunch of evil bastards.

**EDIT 1:** proof sent to mods.

**EDIT 2:** Just so nobody else need ask: a council house is British cheap housing owned and managed by a local authority (regional government) rented out to tennants who can't afford (or don't want) to rent or buy privately owned property. Council estates refers to large numbers of low rise council owned buildings in one area, used to house entire communities. A council block is a high rise of flats. The best widely familiar example of a high rise council flat I can think of is Del Boy's flat in Only Fools and Horses. 

**EDIT 3:** I should probably point out that council flats/houses does not necessarily equal run down slums, ghettos of drug addled crazies or large swathes of criminal immigrants milking the system for all its worth. All this exists, of course, but there are an equal number of well maintained council properties and the vast majority of council tennants are regular, nice, law abiding citizens. The nature of my job (i.e. repairing void tennancies where damage has been caused or the tennant lived in such a horrible way that he left the property in a vile mess) means I wound up seeing the worst end of the spectrum, not the best. So the stories I have to tell reflect this. Just don't make the mistake of thinking they represent what is the absolute norm.

**EDIT 4:** I'm getting a lot of accusations of being American. I'm not sure why. Some people are saying I use American spelling. All I can guess is I'm using Chrome, which does the spell check thing as I type and if it pulls up an error I change it to the suggestion. All the suggestions appear to be American spellings. I am very British thankyou very much, but used to using a sort of neutral language online so as not to confuse non-Brits who are, frankly, in the minority. Maybe that also has something to do with it. "

Guys/Girls feel free to ask me anything you want to know.

Alright guys its getting late and I am going to call it a night. Thanks for your kind words and your questions. It means a lot to me to hear what you guys thought about what I do today. To me it has just become a regular job especially since I have been raised around it.

384,IAmA,"Would you be interested in seeing ""Would you be interested in an AMA from...?"" posts be eliminated with extreme prejudice?","IAMA,

I am one of you guys...I browse IAMA for fun and educational profit like many of you do, but one thing that has irked me (and many of you) for a long time are these ""Would you be interested in an AMA from...?"" submissions.

YES! The answer is yes. If you have access to someone you think the community might want to have an AMA from, then the answer is yes before you even ask the question, especially if that person is well-known. So here's the deal, **you don't need to ask for community approval**. It's not necessary, because the answer is yes! 

You say you know the mayor of Detroit? He might want to do an AMA you say? Pick up your phone, call him/her up, and get their ass on here! Reddit will want to ask them questions. I promise.

You'll notice that I have already added this to our sidebar, so it's all official-like.
***
**EDIT 1: ""A rebuttal""*** 

So to outline the response here, i've got the normal bell curve of people who agree and disagree with whatever it is i'm saying, and I've seen a lot of good discussion back and forth as to the pros and cons. At this point, I want to offer my reasoning here.

* Yes, there is a voting system. Yes, I get that it should be used to downvote posts that people don't like. My argument is that while the voting system works just fine, ""would you be interested in"" posts just don't belong here. It's not an AMA and it's not an AMA request. Ultimately, I'd like to see an IAMA free of AMA requests as well, and the mods here have been working on a solution, but for the purposes of this thread, **""are you interested?"" posts don't fit in here.** It'd be like having a DAE post get on the front page of IAMA. It just doesn't belong.

* I really don't understand the reasoning behind using these posts as a tool to convince someone that it's worth their time. If you're trying to get someone with some fame behind them to do an AMA, and you can't convince them to do it based on your personal relationship with them, then having numbers as a means to persuade them would have questionable effect on their decision i'd argue.

AMAA","Of course, as in most workplaces, ""suggestions"" are requirements-in-waiting. I'm sure if I don't adopt these ""new methods"" I'll get a bad review come June.

They talk and talk about improving our state test grades, but once the news cameras are gone this is how they really want us to run our classes -make them so easy everyone can pass without doing any work at all. Then they blame the low test scores on ""lazy teachers"" and the Union. It's beyond sick.

Here's the list:


Multiple Choice
-------------------
Consider open book tests using page references 

Limit to one word or short phrases

Provide only one choice per letter (eliminate: A and B &amp; All of the Above)

Eliminate: None of the Above

Offer a maximum of 3 choices

Avoid using negatives in questions (Which of these is not...)



True-False
-------------
Avoid negative or comparative wording (which is NOT, etc.)

Avoid the use of specific determiners (always, never, and no)

Balance the number of true answers to the number of false (Ex: tell the students ""there are 5 true and 5 false"")

If this is impractical, at least tell the student how many of each (5 true, 7 false)

Eliminate the need to rephrase false statements to make them true


Fill-in &amp; Completion
------------------------
one word answers or short phrases only

Provide a word bank and/or page number clues

Give the first letter of the answer

Limit the number of fill-in-the-blank responses to 1 per question (Ex: President [blank] was the 1st President of America, his vice president was [blank]  is not recommended.)


Essays
---------
Weigh the merit of using any essay questions at all

If you must use essay questions:

Allow students to list answers without complete sentences

Provide ""answer starters"" (provide the first sentence or paragraph from a well-written essay)

Consider providing open book or notebook time


There were several other references to ""consider giving open book tests with page references"" that I eliminated as redundant. Geez, I wonder what they want all our tests to be from now on, but can't come right out and say it? I could never guess...


EDIT: Thanks for all the great questions guys - I'm headed to bed. I will try to be back on tomorrow to answer some more. If I did not answer your question that means someone else had already asked an identical question that I had responded to, so try searching the thread.

Also, I will not identify my state or district so stop asking. Thanks!

I joined the industry straight out of Uni, worked for three years, became a technical director, lost my way, quit and made a game with my friends.

Whose Line was COMPLETELY MADE UP. We had no advanced notice of suggestions.

After 1,000s of hours of improv, I have no favorite, crazy memory of a particular moment of doing improv. (I can barely remember anything from the show until I see it on TV- that's true for all the guys)

My favorite scene from WLIIa is Colin on the Richard Simmons jet ski.

Colin, Ryan, Greg, Colin, Wayne, Drew, and Chip are all truly VERY nice guys.
(All of them are shy in real life) They were all very fun to improvise with.

398,IAmA,IAmA guy that hasn't pooped in the month of August yet. Ask me anything about my extreme constipation.,"My last bowel movement was July 29th, for the last 10 days I have limited myself to one bowl of cereal a day, b/c the bloating is just too painful. I have gained 11 pounds during this entire ordeal. I've tried everything from coffee enemas to stretching. Nothing has worked. My doctor now has me on 4 different medications and I am about to do 2 different types of Enemas. He swears I shall see something pass today. 

For the first time in a long while I do actually feel something going on in my lower stomach. My doctor warned, with extreme constipation of this sort, I may actually rip my anus from the impacted poop. This has forced me to take muscle relaxers and actually have to apply Vaseline to my anus twice a day.

I will keep you updated, and for you Reddit, if I release this beast, I promise to take pictures. That is if you want me to. My doctor guesses this will weigh close to 6 pounds! So buckle up and pray for my butthole.

This is the first time this has happened to me. I've gone 7 days before, but nothing like this. around day 18-20 I had to lay in bed and not move b/c the feces was causing cramps. I've had night sweats for the last week. It's gone to far, today I dont care if I rip my anus, I'm going to go to the damn bathroom!

Edit: Off to take enema numero uno, I'll be back in 10 minutes! 

Here is a picture of my setup in case I pass out - advice from my doctor**
http://i.imgur.com/X4fAY.jpg 

Off to take enema number 2, I'll be back to 15 mins. I'll also take stomach bloat pic as requested

This prob does look like much, but I'm 6'3 and weigh 175, and have to lean forward to see my toes **
http://i.imgur.com/vbfZb.jpg

Edit: guys my girlfriend has been reading your comments and thinks we need to go to another doctor, I'm kinda concerned reading your comments regarding anal tearing and his lack of attention to it. Going to go to a 24 hour clinic, I'll report back when I get home. It's cramping again and I can barely stand up. Thanks for your support. Meanwhile you have my girlfriend rather worried about our doctor of 3 years 

Edit: Here's attempt number 1 for trying to get it out after the enema. Warning that this is graphic: http://i.imgur.com/D6S6l.jpg

Edit: Final update for a while guys. I'm posting this from the hospital. There are doctors and nurses wearing what looks like very expendable clothing. The doctor tells me there will be a manual retrieval that should have happened days ago. I know that you guys aren't the praying type but I need some sort of God on my side right now. I'd say that I'm scared shitless and I think that's a pretty accurate statement. Updates as soon as humanly possible. Reddit, I'm *scared* now. 

**12:01 CST Update - Sorry I fell off the face of the earth earlier. I went in to the hospital and had a rather unpleasant experience.  They gave me a drug called 'golytely' and some other mild sedatives that basically allowed my ass to loosen up enough to where a nurse(male) could get his claw mouse grip into my asshole(Manual Disimpaction) and rip out what felt like a sword. In reality, the clog was about twice the size of a golfball. I really did ask if I could take a picture of it, but they just laughed it off and took it away. On a bright note, I asked if that was all that was coming. He laughed and said I was in for a grand finale after my next enema. I am too exhausted to even thinking about taking on that chore tonight. Me and my asshole are currently not on speaking terms. It's sore and feels violated. No lacerations, but very, very sore. Tomorrow is the day Reddit, tomorrow is the day. For your support all day and advice to go to the damn hospital, you shall be rewarded with countless pictures.**

Also, whoever bought me reddit gold, much appreciated! It was the gift I needed in an otherwise bad day.

1:00am - I could stay up all night and chat with you guys, but I'm afraid my drugs are taking hold. I'm off to bed! See ya tomorrow!

My doctors are stumped and no medication has worked. At first it was amusing, but it's now having a negative impact on my life.

**I'm open to trying anything that might make my hiccups stop.**

I'm reposting this with proof of my hiccups. You can watch a livestream of me [here](http://ustre.am/12THf). And [here's](http://imgur.com/Thwixld) a picture of some the medications that have failed to cure me.

Edit: I'm going to have to stop the live stream for a little bit. I'll keep answering questions and get the live stream back up soon. Thanks for all the suggestions.

Edit: The live stream is back up. Knock yourselves out if watching a bearded man hiccup is your sort of thing.

Edit: I've been live streaming hiccups for over 10 hours, it's gone 4.00am and I must get some sleep. I've been blown away by all the questions and suggestions, if I haven't answered you I'll try and do it tomorrow. As I said I'll work my way through your suggestions and will record some of them on camera. It might take a week or so to put things together but OP will deliver.

Our [website](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu) describes what we do and how to contact us.

Whenever a popular article is posted about astronomy on Reddit, we notice that a lot of questions float around typically. A few of us have personally tried to answer questions but we thought it might be a good idea to get involved as a team. Answering questions tonight are five students:

Rebecca Harbison - Planetary science, looking at the particle size distribution in the rings of Saturn using data from [Cassini](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/‎).

The Mike Jones - Using HI surveys [ALFALFA](http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/‎) of the local Universe in order to better understand the local galactic environment.

Michael Lam - Pulsar timing with the [NANOGrav](http://www.nanograv.org) collaboration, looking at removing the effects of the interstellar medium on the times-of-arrival of our pulses to help us in the eventual detection of gravitational waves. 

Sean Marshall - Radar and infrared observations and shape modeling of near-Earth asteroids.

Tyler Pauly - Astrochemical modeling of protostellar clouds, looking at the formation of complex molecules in low temperature environments.

All staff at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are welcome (and invited) to participate in questions they are qualified to answer. JPL has a pretty decent sized presence on Reddit, so I am sure there will be many contributors with a wide range of experience to share. 

Even if the local group isn't up for answering questions, us folks at [Educated Earth](http://www.EducatedEarth.net) have found at least a couple of engineers who would be happy to answer your questions. 

The credentials and proof for EducatedEarth's contacts are coming shortly, they are just starting their day at the office and need to get settled in. There will be a comment below for any additional contributors to prove themselves.

**Edit: Great to see so many professionals, NASA and otherwise, joining in on the comments to fill in for the lull in responses from my friends.**

**It is great to see so much interest in the sciences and astronomy on Reddit, I never expected this to make front page. I have contacts at a couple of other agencies, I will see what I can do about making future group posts like this. After the delay in getting confirmation this time, I now know to get the proof from them beforehand for the next one :)**

This is my first time trying to post on a website like this, so please bear with me!


I'm an 83-year-old author with over 30 years of writing experience, although I've only just recently self-published my first novel on Amazon, after having tried for ten years to get this book published through traditional means.


My novel is a family saga called ""The Falcon and the Dove"" and it's currently only available as a digital download through Amazon ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Falcon-Dove-ebook/dp/B0097OZA1Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362247141&amp;sr=8-1 ) , although I plan to make it available through other outlets. The link for those in the USA is: http://www.amazon.com/The-Falcon-Dove-ebook/dp/B0097OZA1Y/ref=tmm_kin_title_0  Thank you to those kind commenters who pointed that out to me.


As part of a writing course thirty years ago I had to write several short stories. One in particular made me think I could expand it so that is what I eventually did. By this time I had already been writing for several years, including a book about the lives of my parents, one about my time as a student at agricultural college, one about my time in Taiwan. None of these I had published but I was able to draw on these experiences when writing The Falcon and the Dove. This took five years to complete in between working as a gardener, travelling to Taiwan to work as a volunteer teacher, visiting family and friends in England and abroad.


I was born in Taiwan/Formosa, the youngest of five children of missionary parents. We came home to England when I was only one year old, to live in Eastleigh, near Southampton. My mother taught me at home, as she had my brothers and sister while in Formosa, until 1939 when I started school at the age of ten, then in the war I was evacuated to Malvern. At the end of the war I had hoped to train to be a vet but as that was not possible I trained instead to join the Land Army. I worked, mainly in dairying, until the Land Army disbanded in 1951 when I married my husband who was a farm worker. We had five children and I now have the joy of not only the addition of their partners but fifteen grand children and six great grand children. I still enjoy gardening, joining family events, church activities, working with children, volunteering, U3A, travelling.


Please feel free to ask me about my life, my first published novel, or my writing in general!


Kind Regards,

Elizabeth 

Update:

When possible on location I 'Tweet' so if you are interested in following what I'm up to then please [follow me there](http://www.twitter.com/gavinthurston)

**In an attempt to answer the common question: How did I get started?**

 I took my first photo aged 10 with a very simple box camera. Oddly, it was of an Orca in captivity at Windsor Safari Park (now Legoland) in the UK whilst on a school trip. I found it magical that by one press of a button you could capture a moment in time and share it for years to come.
 My passion for photography grew over the years at school where I taught myself to process and print my black and white photographic efforts.

 I left school at 18 with the idea of going to University in London to study 'Film and Photographic Science' (yawn, thank goodness I didn't!). I needed a holiday job for 9 weeks before Uni to get some beer money so on the day I left school I literally walked into a small film company called Oxford Scientific Films near where my parents lived. I managed to show them my photographic portfolio and they gave me an interview there and then! They offered me a temporary job but said they couldn't pay me but they would pay my bus fare and give me lunch. I loved the place, work and people so much that I asked for a permanent job and skipped University. I learnt sooo much over the next 4 years working with wildlife and on commercials, feature films and IMAX (as a tea boy mostly). Sweeping, tidying up, holding lights, cleaning lenses etc. etc. I learnt by watching the masters of their crafts.

 The pay was appalling and so I had all sorts of evening jobs like selling loft insulation, Betterware door to door and as a cocktail barman at a Harvester restaurant.

 Finally after 4 years I knew it all and needed to move on to greater things and more pay so applied for jobs with the BBC. I got several interviews and finally got a job as assistant cameraman at BBC Bristol. I worked there for another 4 years alongside some of the greats including Alan Heyward, Andrew Dunn, Martin Saunders, Hugh Maynard etc. (IMDB or Google them). At the BBC I realised I didn't know diddly-squat about the job and so stepped onto an even steeper learning curve that I have never got off.

 After another 4 years the pay was again not enough to support me, my wife and child on the way. The advice I was given with the reputation I had been building was to go freelance. Amazingly, word spread and in the space of 2 weeks I had been offered 2 year contracts with NHK, Partridge Films and the BBC NHU as a freelancer!! They were all offering interest free loans so that I could buy a camera kit and then work to pay off the loan. I was gobsmacked and took the BBC offer as it was where I was based and new the producers etc. The BBC leant me £18,000 ($30,000) and I bought a second hand ARRI HSR 16mm film camera and lens. On the strength of a 2 year contract in my hand the bank lent me a further amount (which I am still paying off until 2022! as part of my mortgage even though the camera was superseded 10 years ago).
 
 I remember my first big job as a freelancer was filming Terns (birds) on the Farne Islands off the north east coast of UK. The producer Neil Lucas accompanied me up there and helped me into the tiniest of fishing trawlers (think miniature Deadliest Catch) with my newly purchased camera kit. I didn't have insurance and pictured loosing the lot to the sea. The sequence turned out fine for a David Attenborough series called 'The Trials of Life'.  The rest as they say is (Natural) history. 

 After 30 years in this career I am still married with two sons (who put me up to doing this Reddit IAmA). I am still working full time.

**Some brief advice on how you can get started**

 My advice to anyone wanting a career in Wildlife film making: Firstly, get out there with any camera you can get your hands on. Get photographing or videoing. Build a portfolio and hone your skills, use the internet and books for advice on technique and find out for yourself whether this really is your passion. Could and would you sit in a hide for 4 weeks, 15 hours a day on the off chance of capturing a unique piece of behaviour? If you find yourself complaining at all then I suggest you try something else. If you love it and want more, then go for it.

 I am a great believer that you make your own luck and opportunities in this life. Don't just follow the normal path, think outside the box to make your luck change. Any employer in any business will only employ you if you are going to bring some skill to their company. You need to build your skills so that you can offer something to the wildlife film making industry rather than just saying 'I always wanted to do this'. If you have a talent or skill or knowledge to offer then someone will want you to work for them. 

 If any of you want feedback on video or photographic efforts then I will be keeping a check on this IAmA thread over the next few months or perhaps longer if there is still interest. Remember we all have to start somewhere.

Thank you.

412,IAmA,"I am (another) former Fox News Channel employee, AMA.","I've seen a few of these pop up from time to time, thought I'd add in my own experiences. I was actually very reluctant to do this AMA, because a few folks I've talked to who have done the same thing ... say they got death threats and other nasty messages. Hence the burner account.

But I don't want the opinions of a few to prevent me from sharing my experiences at FNC. I left last year, after a few years in the newsroom. I worked on the ""editorial"" side - dayside, specifically - not for any of the prime-time shows (like O'Reilly and Hannity) so I can only speak more generally about them and their relationship to the daytime news operation.

I'll try to answer any questions you may have about the culture, operation and general day-to-day happenings at 1211 Avenue of the Americas. I'm not here to debate politics, as I'm sure the general assumptions about FNC are clear, but my personal beliefs don't really align with the stereotypical Fox viewer.

Mods can contact me for proof, and I will provide it.

Until then - ask away - and be gentle.

416,IAmA,I saved a girl from drowning. She then sued me. AMA.,"I am a trained swimmer and completed all classes to become a lifeguard. However, swimming never was more than a hobby for me and I chose a totally different career path.

In 2007 I saved a girl from drowning. For those of you unexperienced with seashores and beaches, the sea will always push you back to the shore unless you are further than a given point. After this given point , the strong current will either push you deeper into the sea, or keep you where you are. You can't just ""float"" back to the shore; you will drown for exhaustion.

In 2007 I was at the beach with a few friends when I noticed a girl way too far from the shore. By ""too far"", I mean way too far: at least twice as far as any other person. Her gestures were clear: she was drowning, barely keeping her head above water. I turned around: no lifeguard. I later learned the man chose to take a break and was at the bathroom.

To make this clear: she was getting futher and further from the shore by the second. I'm a good swimmer: I raced to her, then carried her on my back to the shore, keeping her above water. She had already swallowed a lot of water. I risked my own life because my weight with hers could have been too much. But I made it.

The lady later sued me. Now, I learned later that she had to spend three days at the hospitals, couldn't afford it, tried to sue the beach owners but her case was rejected, but she still sued me. Her case? I should have saved her earlier. I had been careless, not carrying her to the shore fast enough, and should have let the lifeguard do his job (yes, you read that right). I had injured her, she was in pain, she wouldn't have swallowed as much water, if that makes any sense, etc etc etc. 

I had the case thrown out by a judge, but still had to hire a lawyer, and to suffer the humiliation. It was an unnecessary stress. I felt disgusted and betrayed. AMA.

421,IAmA,Mitch Hunter (Full Face Transplant),"I've been a long time reader but never made an account here until my friend shared some of my story in a facial reconstruction  post. I was the second person in the US to have a full face transplant and third in the world. As far as full and partials go, I was the third in the US and I think fifteenth in the world. 

I know I will get asked as to why I needed one, so I will clear that up. In 2001 I was in a single cab pick-up truck. The driver lost control around a turn and ran into a utility pole, cracking it in half and putting a lot of power lines around the truck. When his gf exited the vehicle, she was struck by one of the downed lines, I immediately got her off and was struck myself. I do not remember thirty minutes before the accident or thirty days after (drug induced coma). Everything I know is by eye witness accounts. I'm probably fortunate to have not remembered that much pain. Though after waking up, I was still in a lot of pain. My left leg was still being amputated further upas the infection kept spreading. Luckily it finally stopped spreading and my knee was saved. 

I'm new to Reddit so this is my first AmA. I hope I did it right. Feel free to ask me questions and I will do my best to answer them. You can view my youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/user/Fifth0555. My FB medical page is https://www.facebook.com/DeathIsScaredOfMe. There I have an album called ""progression"" which shows pictures of before the accident, after the accident, and the healing stages after the transplant. My newest one is the profile pic taken this week. My personal FB is https://www.facebook.com/Mitch.W.T.F though I have it pretty locked down, so a lot of the pics on it can't be viewed, even by subscribers. Feel free to add me though, I'm a pretty down to Earth guy and enjoy meeting new people, from different parts of the world. 

Like I said, feel free to ask me questions and I will do the best I can to answer them all. If I get swamped, just be patient, I will eventually get to your question. Hope everyone is having a great weekend. Thank you all for the warm welcome I have received thus far.

427,IAmA,"By Request: I design frozen dinners, AMA","Hi Reddit!

I work for Nestle Prepared Foods in Solon, Ohio. I'm a member of the team that designs products for brands like Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine, and Buitoni. I'm happy to answer any questions that you have. Just keep in mind that I can't divulge anything confidential.

[Here's Verification](http://imgur.com/ASz0n)

The requester had some questions:

Q: Does it ever look like what's on the packaging?

We use the actual product when we do photo shoots, but the photographers take some ""artistic liberties."" They might position the ingredients in a particular way or put the product on a plate or something like that. Part of our job as the food technologists is to make sure that the photographers don't go too far to the point that the photo is misleading.


Q: What is in TV Dinners that we're happy not knowing about?

Not much really. This is a bit of a misconception. Actually our frozen meals don't need to be formulated with preservatives because freezing is the only preservative we need. The weirdest thing you're going to find on the label is probably xanthan gum, which is just a carbohydrate that serves as a thickener. In our factories, we make the meal from scratch, assemble the components in a tray, freeze it, put it in a box, and ship it to you. Pretty simple.


Q: What kind of testing goes on?

We do all sorts of tests. We're given lots of contstraints that we have to meet, and our job as food technologists is to formulate a product that meets all of the requirements. We have to design something that can feasibly be made in our factory, at a particular cost limit, within a set of nutritional requirements, without posing any safety concerns, while still delivering on product quality.
So we begin by trying out different formulations in our test kitchen that meet those requirements. We test and test until we get a product that we're happy with, and then we scale it up. We do tests on a larger scale to make sure that the product we envisioned can actually be made in the factory. We test just about anything you can imagine as long as the company feels the cost of the test is justified.

439,IAmA,IAmA guy who shot my father in self defense AMA,"Alright guys I'm pretty new here so don't bash my spelling mistakes too hard.

http://www.heartlandconnection.com/news/story.aspx?id=326441#.UKqnUIf7I_g

Well my dad was drinking pretty heavily that night. (counted 18 beers in about 2 hours) and generally speaking when he was drunk there was GOING to be a fight. The night started with just the general passive aggressive wordplay and then progressed to screaming and eventually him telling me to hit him (so that he would have an excuse to beat the shit out of me I guess). Eventually he just snapped and went for a small .22 revolver in another room my mom got to it first and my uncle + mom played keep away with it. Eventually my he wrestled it away from my uncle and started pulling the trigger but my uncle had his finger in between the hammer and managed to throw it outside into the dark. Dad then decided he was leaving and he got his keys and went outside. He came back in 3 minutes later muttering about him leaving was what we wanted him to do. He then made a B-line for my room which contains many assorted knives and weapons. My mom ran into the room and tried to wrestle the knife away from him and he grabbed her hair with one hand and had the knife in the other (kinda like a human shield) and as soon as I saw that I knew I had to do it. So I reached into the drawer and pulled out my .44 mag and shot him in the liver/stomach area.
EDIT: I answered this elsewhere but I can't seem to find it. He didn't die right away. The police arrived and cuffed/interrogated me, but no charges were filled and they called it a very clear cut case of self defense. He was air lifted to a nearby hospital, fighting the police and medical staff the entire time. He fell unconcious never woke up, and died three days later.

I am Gov. Gary Johnnson, the Libertarian candidate for President of the United States, and the two-term Governor of New Mexico from 1994 - 2003.

Here is proof that this is me: https://twitter.com/GovGaryJohnson/status/245597958253445120

I've been referred to as the 'most fiscally conservative Governor' in the country, and vetoed so many bills that I earned the nickname ""Governor Veto."" I bring a distinctly business-like mentality to governing, and believe that decisions should be made based on cost-benefit analysis rather than strict ideology.

I'm also an avid skier, adventurer, and bicyclist. I have currently reached four of the highest peaks on all seven continents, including Mt. Everest.

463,IAmA,[AMA Request] Texas Senator Wendy Davis,"1. What are some of the difficulties being a woman senator from Texas?
2. Did you realize the amount of support on your behalf from the online community during or after the filibuster?
3. If you had a chance to do anything differently during the filibuster, what would it be?
4. Do you have any long term political aspirations, i.e. is it too early for Davis 2016?
5. What is the greatest thing you have taken away from this experience?

50 year old Texas State Senator, former teen and single mother who also became the first person in her family to go to college (Harvard Law School), who for 10 hours and 45 minutes led a filibuster against an overreaching abortion bill which ensures closures of most of the abortion clinics in Texas meaning that women will not have adequate reproductive care. During the filibuster Wendy Davis, had to stay within 3 feet of her desk talking, without pausing, drinking, eating, going to the washroom, leaning on her desk, etc. She is an inspiration to women and men alike. I watched approximately four hours of the filibuster and was impressed by Senator Davis' candor, knowledge, and conviction."
464,IAmA,"I’m Isha Datar, director of New Harvest – the non-profit largely responsible for advancing “cultured meat.” I was at the first ever cultured beef burger tasting in London this past Monday – AMA!","[New Harvest](http://www.new-harvest.org) was founded in 2004 to support the development of cultured meat (AKA “in vitro meat”) and plant-based meat alternatives. We connect scientists in the field to one another and to funds. We support food technology research that remains in the public domain.

I was fortunate enough to attend the event last Monday in London where Mark Post, a researcher at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, showcased the first ever cultured beef burger. [Sergey Brin]( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/aug/05/google-sergey-brin-test-tube-burger), the co-founder of Google, was also revealed as the philanthropist behind the project.

Why meat alternatives? Meat production is a leading driver of climate change, a massive burden on environmental resources, and a breeding ground for epidemic disease.Meat alternatives hold a lot of promise in feeding a growing population more safely and efficiently.

**Some links you may be interested in:**

* We got a lot of initial help from our kissing cousin Kickstarter campaign, [The Machine of Death] (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1234131468/machine-of-death-the-game-of-creative-assassinatio)! *(Which is ending in 12 hours so make sure you check it out while you still have time!)*

* [Colin Mochrie let us make a card based on him!](https://twitter.com/colinmochrie/status/311340292324335616)

* Story War is a card game structured similar to [Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/) but focuses more on the questions like ""who would win in a fight between Medusa and King Midas"" than on word association. It plays sort of like a more open-ended and accessible version of Dungeons and Dragons.

* We've playtested over 500 individual rounds with a diverse mix of people. We've noticed a common thread of people who don't normally like card games getting the most excited about it.

* The Kickstarter is going to end on Friday at 4pm, *while* we're running a demo booth at **PAX East**.

My hopes have slowly been diminished and crushed as requirements from 'upper management' become more strict, and not on promoting people to work harder but discouraging people from being helpful. The red tape that we drown in over the phone gives us the ability to say ""Sorry"" and if you talk to a good person they'll actually pray your issue gets fixed as it flows down the rusted, broken down pipe.

Greedy lying manipulative sales people, technicians that blame dispatch and a dispatch that blames technicians, a training department that spends eight weeks on how to setup an account and two weeks on how to fix issues, outsourcing agents (OSRs) that **DO** read from scripts for out of date billing/repair systems and still manage to mess things up.

The stress from being one of the few in my office that know how to, and actually want to, fix things is over-whelming when it seems there are more rules in place to prevent that than help. I've got a teaspoon to poke at an ocean of problems. Feel free to ask me anything.

487,IAmA,"IAmA Columbine survivor named Brooks Brown. I was friends with the killers, a few victims, was scapegoated by the police as being involved, went on to do lots of anti-bullying activism for many years before I gave it up. AMA","So, that's the short version. The longer version is a bit of a pain to go over entirely. I was a senior at the time of the massacre, and was the guy Eric told to 'get out of here' because he 'liked me now'. My family was the one who reported Eric Harris almost two dozen times to the police for death threats and various things which they never followed up on. After the terrible day, my family and I went to the press to show the world that the police botched this one up - and instead the police lied, saying we never did such a thing, then they began telling the media and the families that I was involved in the killing.

I quickly became a pariah in the area, lost all but a handful of my friends, and became a semi-regular news feature. I spent the next few years in front of TV cameras, working on documentaries of all sorts, writing my book, and going from school to school talking about the dangers of bullying. I also spent much time reading, studying, talking to psychologists, experts, and others to try to understand why it happened. It consumed my life wholly. 

Then I quit all of that to move to SF to work on videogames and leave all that shit behind. It's been liberating. A while ago my Reddit account got outed as mine in a post about the work I'm doing now, and since then I've been sent messages saying I should do an AMA. So, here I am. 12 years in, hundreds of miles away. So, ask me anything. (edited due to stupid wording I had used)

EDIT: Submitted photo for the AMA to the mods. [Link here](http://yfrog.com/gy8wbbuj). glad to see it make the front page. Your kind words are fantastic to read today, and I know a bunch of other Columbiners who are on here and its good to know it's still in your thoughts. I'm answering as fast as I can. 

Edit 2: Finally reading through the discussions and they're pretty fantastic. At least the civil ones. That's why I love reddit &lt;3

Edit 3: That's it for now. 4 hours straight on Reddit is well over my daily requirement. I'll try to read more and answer more throughout the day. I think I replied to many, and almost every one with more than a few upvotes. I certainly didn't expect  1500 comments. thanks for all the kind words you guys/gals. It's definitely helped :)

Edit 4: So I don't have to answer a ton of dupe questions about the bullying, I'm pointing to two articles, [one from that year](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/june99/columbine12.htm), [and another from 7 years later](http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8115&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35&amp;PAGE=1) and [the amazing response to that one](http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8452&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35). The bullying was real. the shooters were NOT bullies, and there is a TON of stuff to back it up.  

Special callout to Spuds2600 and others for the Reddit Gold. I could NOT have answered as many as I did as easily as i did if it weren't for him. you rule!"

-Little Caesar's
-Marco's
-Papa John's

Ask away about my job(s). 

EDIT: Back soon, running out for a few. Will post pics of all the uniforms here in a minute.


EDIT: Done for now. Been an overwhelming response, and I've been answering as many questions as I can for 3 hours straight. 
Thanks for asking. 

I was also only able to locate my Pizza Hut uniform. One of my friends borrowed my Marco's shirt(he went in early and couldn't find his), and I must have thrown out or given away my PJ's/Domino's uniforms.

491,IAmA,AMA Request: Trey Parker and Matt Stone,"1. Everyone loved The Book of Mormon. Can we ever expect a live musical adaptation of the South Park BLU?

2. South Park has been going on for 16 seasons. How much longer do you expect (or want) to continue making the show?

3. Any ideas for season 17 (please tell me you'll do an episode about Edward Snowden)?

4. South Park has covered several very controversial topics, often considered too taboo for TV. Is there a topic you aren't willing to cover?

5. You guys are now making a transition to reality TV with your new fishing show starring Les Claypool. How do you feel about this?



Trey Parker and Matt Stone can be contacted by mail at:

**Trey Parker &amp; Matt Stone**

**c/o William Morris Agency**

**151 El Camino Drive**

**Beverly Hills, CA 90212**

or

**Trey Parker &amp; Matt Stone**

**c/o Comedy Central**

**1775 Broadway** 

**New York, NY 10019**

They can also be contacted via fan email at **news@southparkstudios.com**

EDIT: Also, free pro tip for all of you guys who are complaining about South Park no longer being available on Netflix. You can stream episodes for free, ad-free at southparkstudios.com . Best of all, it's totally legal, and available in HD. Sure it may not be as convenient as Netflix, but I don't see South Park returning to Netflix any time too soon (plus, Trey and Matt have no control over this kind of stuff, it's all up to the licensing company)."

So maybe look at the answers already there and see if I've gotten to a version of your Q?  I dunno.  

UPDATE 5: Wednesday afternoon.  Just spent some quality time here, but now have to get back to my day job.  I'm flattered and overwhelmed by all the Qs, but it looks like I won't be able to get to all of them.  But I WILL pop by here and there over the next few days and try to get to more of 'em, especially if they're Qs I haven't answered in some way before.  Thank you!  Carry on!

UPDATE 6:  Friday afternoon. Spending about 90 minutes answering a few more questions I couldn't get to, then I will leave you in peace.

UPDATE 7:  Later Friday afternoon: wrapping up here after answering a bunch more Qs.  Sorry I had to leave so many unanswered, but it seems like people have wisely moved on to other threads anyway.  Go with them!  LIVE, whatever you do!

495,IAmA,I am a 20-year-old with a progressive wasting disease called spinal muscular atrophy that will eventually kill me. I invite you to laugh at my nightmare.,"I have always believed that the best way to overcome adversity is by approaching it with a sense of humor and a positive attitude. Knowing that there's a chance my lungs could stop working while I am sleeping tonight is terrifying, but life is too beautiful to waste time wallowing in that reality.

I started a blog called Laughing At My Nightmare to share funny stories about my life, and it has gained over 300,000 followers. The popularity of my blog blew me away, and showed me that I have the opportunity to positively influence the lives of many people. I started a nonprofit in order to continue spreading my stories and to raise money for muscular dystrophy research.

This Thursday, April 11th, I am taking it to the next level with a massive Twitter bomb for Ellen DeGeneres. Please check out my blog (www.laughingatmynightmare.tumblr.com) for details about this operation, and get as many people to take part as you can. Not only will it change my life if it works, but it would give me the opportunity to make a real impact on this world, which is something I feel I need to do before I die.

And I would love to answer any questions that you have about my life or my blog or the Ellen operation!

(EDIT) I want to make sure I provide proof, so I do I have this up on my blog.  I hope that's enough!  http://laughingatmynightmare.1000notes.com/post/47374410535/just-did-my-first-iama-on-reddit

Follow me on Twitter! @shaner528

(EDIT) This response was so much better than I expected.  Because of my disease I can only do so many responses at a time (I just get tired), so I'll come back and answer as many as I can over time.  Thank you SO MUCH for talking to me!"
496,IAmA,"IAmA former meth lab operator, AMAA","So, let's see.  I have an educational background in polymer chemistry, and have been diagnosed with both ADHD and bipolar disorder.  I had been going through the mental health system about four years, trying all sorts of different medications for both disorders, without having any real improvement.  So, as kind of an act of desperation, I tried various illegal drugs.  I discovered that the combination of indica-strain marijuana and low-dose methamphetamine allowed me to virtually eliminate all symptoms of both disorders, and become a very successful medical researcher.  But because methamphetamine is so hard to obtain where I live, I used my chemistry background to make the stuff.  I've made it via the iodine/phosphorus reaction, and via the Grignard reaction and reductive amination.  I never sold methamphetamine, although I have sold mushrooms and weed.  I've seen the first four seasons of Breaking Bad, which started well after I already was doing this.  I was caught by the police over a year ago.  The way they caught me was pretty much really, really bad luck on my part.  The police searched my car and found a few chemical totally unrelated to methamphetamine manufacturing, but according to police, chemicals=meth lab.  Some powder in my car tested positive for ephedrine, even though it was not ephedrine or even a related chemical, and this prompted a search of all of my possessions.  I thought I could get away with it because of the very limited quantities I was making, but didn't count on Bad-Luck Brian levels of luck.

Also, this ordeal has given me a lot of insight into the way the criminal justice system works in the US, the way the healthcare system works in the US, the way mental health and addiction are treated, and the extent to which the pharmaceutical industry controls government policy.  An example: methamphetamine is available by prescription under the name Desoxyn, for treating narcolepsy and ADHD, but only one company is allowed to make it.  A prescription will cost a person with no insurance about $500 a month, not counting doctor's visits.  The same amount of dextromethamphetamine can be purchased on the street for about $100, or manufactured by an individual for about $10.

Because of my crime, which fell under federal jurisdiction because of transportation across state lines, and involved about 5 grams of pseudoephedrine, I am now a convicted felon for the rest of my life, barring a pardon from the president of the United States.  I am unable to vote, receive financial aid for education, or own a firearm, for the rest of my life.  I spent one month in jail, after falsely testing positive for methamphetamine, essentially because of the shortcomings of the PharmaChek sweat patch drug test.  I lost all of my savings and my job, after being court ordered to live at a location far away from all of that, and having all my mental disorder symptoms come back full force.

While I was using, I did experience many of the negative effects of methamphetamine use, although overall I still believe that physiologically, it was a positive influence on me.  But I can easily see how a methamphetamine addiction could spiral out of control.

So, ask me anything that doesn't involve giving away personally identifying details, and I'll answer to the best of my ability.  I should be verified by the mods.

Edit:  It took me almost a week, but I finally read every question in this AMA, and answered all the ones I could, that hadn't been asked and answered too many times already.  I even read the ones at the bottom, with negative scores on them, even though they were mostly references to Breaking Bad, people who didn't read the intro, and ""fuck you asshole, I hope you burn in hell!"" in various phrasings.  I would like to point out that the point of this AMA was not to brag, or look for sympathy.  It was to try and answer questions relating to meth and its synthesis in as honest and neutral of a tone as I could manage.  People know there's a lot of bullshit out there regarding drugs, and I wanted to clear up as much as I could.  Also, to those people who don't believe my story, believe me, if I was selling this shit, I'd be in prison.

Edit 2: For anyone who thinks my story is unfair, read about [Ernesto Lira](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/31/us/battles-to-change-prison-policy-of-solitary-confinement.html), a man who committed a crime roughly similar in magnitude as mine (though he committed his crime while on parole).  Compared to his story, mine is nothing. 

Edit 3: For those people saying more or less that I committed a crime and got caught, and should accept the punishment, I'm not saying I shouldn't have been punished.  What I'm saying is that taking away more than five years of my life for what was truly a victimless crime seems rather extreme to me.  And taking away certain rights for the rest of my life is beyond insane.  If I had been stealing money from my family to feed an addiction, or buying from a dealer supplied by the Latin American cartels, my punishment would be far less than it is."

501,IAmA,I was wrongly accused by two girls that I was going to bring a gun to school and kill a girl. It took 3 years and a trial by jury to clear my name AMA.,"Hello Reddit my name is Joel and in the spring of 2005 I was wrongly accused of wanting to kill a student in my high school. As you will read some of the other students involved made some pretty bad statements and I do not blame the girls for reporting them. I maintained my innocence and embarked on a civil lawsuit against the girls. It took 3 years and a trial by jury to clear my name of all wrongdoing.  

Couple things I will say now.

1. I was never expelled from the high school.

2. I transferred to a new high school and graduated.

3. I do not know what happened to the other students involved last I heard they transferred to an alternative school for troubled teens and graduated.

4. Most of the people in the reports testified in the jury trial for the defendants including the principal and officers involved.

5. The trial consisted of them bringing multiple friends in saying I threatened to kill them also. This is actually a very important piece because they tried to paint a picture of me doing this to multiple people.

6. My lawyer was very good and caught the people testifying for them in multiple lies.

7. It took less than 1 hour for the jury to side in my favor.

Edit- Thank you for the questions I appreciate all the support from Reddit. I have removed all the documents thank you for taking the time to read and make your own conclusions."

Or, How to Estimate Damn Near Anything* and *Ballparking: Practical Math for Impractical Sports Questions*.  I also maintain a blog called Diary of Numbers. I’m here to estimate answers to all your numerical questions.  Here's some examples I’ve done [before](http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2011/03/death-statistics.html).

Feel free to make your questions funny, thought-provoking, gross, sexy, etc.  I’ll also answer non-numerical questions if you’ve got any.

**Update** It's 11:51 EST.  I'm grabbing lunch, but will be back in 20 minutes to answer more.  

**Update 2.0** OK, I'm back.  Fire away.

**Update 3.0** Thanks for the great questions, Reddit!  I'm sorry I won't be able to answer all of them.  There's 3243 comments, and I'm replying roughly once every 10 minutes, (I type slow, plus I'm doing math.)  At this rate it would take me 22 days of non-stop replying to catch up.

By the way, for those of you that like doing this stuff, I'm going to post a contest on Diary of Numbers tomorrow.  It'll be some sort of estimation-y question, and you can win a free copy of my cheesy sports book.  I know, I know...shameless self-promotion...karma whore...blah blah blah.  Still, hopefully some of you will enter and have some fun with it.

**Final Update**  You guys rock!  Thanks for all the great questions.  I've gotta head out now, (I've been doing estimations for over 7 hours and my left eye is starting to twitch uncontrollably.)  Thanks again!  I'll try to answer a few more early tomorrow."

513,IAmA,"IAmA the 43 year old terminally ill husband and father, back with great news!  ","This AMA was well received:  http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uta5q/iama_terminally_ill_43_year_old_husband_and/

Yesterday I saw my ICD nurse and a doctor who had assessed the information from my last discharge and found something interesting.  I explained this in the AMA, but I'll outline it again here.  The heart goes through several waves as it completes a single beat, illustrated here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rhythm.  The peaks are represented by letters:  P, Q, R, S, and T.  When I first diagnosed and my ICD implanted, I only really had an R point.  The rest were just little mumbles because my heart was so weak.  But what they discovered is that my heart has gotten so strong, that the T point had gotten high enough that the ICD was counting it as another R wave, effectively double counting my heartbeats.  Instead of 176 beats a minute, it thought my heart was in v-fib at 352 beats a minute, and would deliver a shock to reset, or cardiovert, my heart.  It ended up that I never...needed...shocked...at all.  Which sucks, because it *frigging hurts!*  

So my heart had a software bug.  The ICD nurse and a cardiologist logged into my heart using a wireless device, pictured here:  http://imgur.com/9B9vM  (St. Jude Medical makes my ICD).  They programmed my ICD to ignore 200 milliseconds after it sees an R point, so it doesn't pay attention to the T, and counts the next R.  They also set it to ""capture"" my heart when it exceeds 180 beats a minute.  When it happens, my pacemaker will start pacing my heart at 190 beats (it is...uncomfortable, like suddenly being anxious about something) then start marching my heart rate down to a safe level.

End result:  **I should never be shocked again, and my heart maaay be twice as strong as we thought.**  I have a couple of tests, an echocardiogram and a nuclear (or nucular.  Nucular) scan scheduled for later this week to ascertain if my heart is stronger, and if so, exactly how much stronger.

Dying guy no die no more?  Maybe!  My family is ecstatic.  I am ecstatic.  I hope you are all ecstatic, too.  I hope that this fills your day with hope and possibility the way it has filled mine.

Edit:  I've tried to keep up all day, but I'm worn out.  I'll probably check in later tonight, but for now I've got to go and rest.  Thanks, everybody.  Again, everyone's been really great.

Edit 2, The Return:  I got back on for a while, tried to answer everyone, got really tired, going to bed.  Starting to take the downvoting personally, but I've been told it's a bot.  If I didn't answer you, it's because you got lost in the crush, not because I didn't want to take the time personally to thank you for your kind words and wishes.  I'm glad that so many people have taken hope, solace, or inspiration from what is, to me, just trying to stay alive. As always, Reddit, you folks have been really gracious and kind and have given me so much love and support, it makes me cry.  Good night.

Edit the Third, the Search for Spock:  I've been kind of goofing around off and on this morning.  I'm sorry if I haven't messaged you personally, but I can only write ""Thank you"" so many times before my hand turns into a claw.  So if you posted to just say thank you, I want to say it back.  You guys all took time out of your day to say a few kind words and deserve to be acknowledged for it.  I will be going through all the PM's shortly to make sure I did get them all.  

Edit 4, The Voyage Home:  Today are the tests to determine if my heart function has improved.  I should hear either immediately (the techs like me and tell me if things are good before the formal results come back) or tomorrow.  I will update everyone.

Edit 5, The Final:  I have just gotten the test results back and will put them up in...the final post I'll be making on this account.  I just have some friends and family to talk to about this first.  I'm sorry.  "

I'm afraid I'm having some trouble keeping up!  You all have been so authentic and kind, and I really am glad so many people have popped in to ask questions and read through.  I really want to answer each questions and discuss things further with many people, but I need to ske-daddle.  I'll be back soon!

**NEW STUFF**
A quick clarification:  I use the word “Tick” to describe the unvoluntary movements and noises my TS causes me to make.  “Tick” is not the proper spelling, it ought to be “Tic”, but I use Tick for 2 reasons:
1.	 Tick in my personal onomatopoeia of the sound I hear in my head when I tick.
2.	I use words like “Ticky” and “Tickish” when I describe the rate at which I’m ticking, or how I’m feeling.  So for consistency’s sake, I spell the word “Tick”.

**Ticks:**
I can usually feel a tick coming.  It feels just like the “Point of no return” when you sneeze.  Sometimes I can stop it from happening right away, sometimes I can’t, or don’t feeling coming.
When I stop it, I can still feel it there.  If feels similar to when you REALLY have to pee, but can’t get to a bathroom right away, so you have to hold it.  After a few minutes my whole body is SCREAMING to let the ticks come out.  I feel much better after a tick happens.
A tick for me, is a way to “fix” or “release” an uncomfortable sensation that has built up somewhere in my body.  I don’t tick to feel good, I tick to make an area feel normal again.

*Ticks I exhibit:*
I have both motor and vocal ticks.  To be diagnosed with TS you much have motor ticks and at lease one vocal tick.
I jerk my head at my left shoulder.
My right arm flails up, sort of like an odd salute.
Sometimes my head jerk and arm flail happens at the same time.
A leg will “kick out”.
I flex the muscles in my arms and leg.
I furrow my browns.
I stretch my eyes very wide and they stick that way for a bit.
I clench my jaw.
I wheeze out all the air in my lungs and hold it.
I make a small “Hm” sound in the back of my throat.
I repeat words or phrases people say to me, or anything that gets stuck in my head.

**TS and other issues.**
It is common for people with TS to also have ADD, ADHD, OCD, Schizophrenic, or be slightly autistic. (Like Aspergers)
It’s common for us to experience anxiety, insomnia, and depression.
I have TS, there are things I’m OCD about.  I can have anxiety here and there, I’m definitely an insomniac, and I have depression issues.

**Being in public.**
I usually have a good handle of my ticks so I can suppress them or disguise them while I’m in public, but when they do happen, and they are noticeable, I either explain to any strangers who look worried/confused/interested, and if nobody looks worried/confused/interested, I just let it go.

I go to the movies.  I only have a few vocal ticks, and they’re pretty quiet, so I don’t think I’ve even been a disruption.
The only time I’m ever really embarrassed is when young children mime my ticks when they see them.  They’re just being kids, but it still kinda makes me feel sad.

*School*
Nobody made fun of me in high school.
I tried to go to college, however the stress of being on my own and un-related medical issues made my ticks become debilitating, and I could not commute because it was not safe for me to drive.  The school was not accommodating, and I failed out.  I probably could try to go again because my symptoms are much less bothersome now, but I don’t want to.

*Personal Life*
It has never affected my friendships or my ability to find a boyfriend.  All my friends have learned to ignore my ticks, just like I do, and when a tick is funny, they laugh right along with me.  I currently have a GREAT, supportive, loving, and understanding boyfriend.  We live together, and I don’t think he really notices my ticks anymore, unless he ends up getting hit by one.

**Sex**
Yes, I can have sex.
Yes, sometimes I tick during sex, but since my man loves me for me, he has learned to ignore it.
If I ever tick enough to ruin the moment, we take a quick time out and then get back to the fun stuff.

**Treatment**
I currently do not take any kind of medicine.  Medicine is available to me, but it has a bunch of bad side effects, and I don’t want to encounter them if my current symptoms are minor.
On sparse occasions I have used THC recreationally.  THC stops all of my ticks.  I am currently not planning on using THC for medicinal purposes, as it is still illegal in Ohio, but I think that it should be legalized, that way it is an option for me, and many other people, if I need it in the future.

**Supression**
I don’t have a way to describe or advise how to suppress ticks.  I just… Do.  I wish I could find the words to describe it, but it’s like describing a color without using colors.

**Videos**
My identity is not really a secret, but I prefer to not be forthcoming, as this is the internet, and you are all strangers.
I don’t think I will be posting a video, as it will be primarily watched just for people to see me tick, and I don’t want to make a spectacle or a sideshow of myself.  I might consider it in the future, but not today.
As for a picture of myself, I guess that’s okay.

515,IAmA,IAMA sexual assault therapist discussing when orgasm happens during rape. AMA!,"I did an AMA on this a few months ago and have received a number of requests to do it again.

The basic concept of experiencing orgasm during rape is a confusing and difficult one for many people, both survivors and those connected to survivors.

There are people who do not believe it's possible for a woman or man to achieve orgasm during rape or other kinds of violent sexual assault.  Some believe having an orgasm under these circumstances means that it wasn't a ""real"" rape or the woman/man ""wanted"" it.

I've assisted more young women than I can count with this very issue.  It often comes up at some point during therapy and it's extremely embarrassing or shameful to talk about.  However once it's out in the open, the survivor can look at her/his reaction honestly and begin to heal.  The shame and guilt around it is a large part of why some rapes go unreported and why there is a need for better understanding in society for how and why this occurs.

There have been very few studies on orgasm during rape, but the research so far shows numbers from 10% to over 50% having this experience.  In my experience as a therapist, it has been somewhat less than half of the girls/women I've worked with.  (For the record, I have worked with very few boys/men who reported this.)

In professional discussions, colleagues report similar numbers.  Therapists don't usually talk about this publicly as they fear contributing to the idea of victims ""enjoying rape.""  It's also a reason why there isn't more research done on this and similar topics.
My belief is that as difficult a topic as this is, if we can address it directly and remove the shame and stigma, then a lot more healing can happen.  I'm hopeful that the Reddit community is open to learning and discussing topics like this.

I was taken to task in my original discussion for not emphasizing that this happens for boys and men as well.  I referenced that above but am doing it again here to make this point clear.

I was verified previously, but I'll include the documentation again here.  http://imgur.com/eTVei

This is an open discussion and I'm happy to answer any questions.  Don't be afraid if you think it may be offensive as I'd rather have a frank talk than leave people with false ideas.
AMA!

**Edit:** 3:30pm Questions/comments are coming in MUCH faster than I thought.  A lot faster than the other time I did this topic.  I'm answering as fast as I can; bear with me!

**Edit2:** 8:30pm Thank you everyone for all your questions and comments!! This went WAY past what I thought it would be (8 hours, whew!).  I need to take a break (and eat!) but I'll check back on before going to sleep and try to respond to more questions.

**Edit3:** 10:50pm Okay, I'm back and it looks like you all carried on fine without me.  I'll try to answer as many first-order (main thread, no deviations that I have to search for) questions as I can before I fall asleep at the keyboard.  And Front Page! Wow!  Thank you all.  And really I mean Thank You for caring enough about this topic to bring it to the front.  It's most important to me to get this info out to you.

**Edit4:** 2:30am Stayed up way later than I meant to. It kept being just one more question that I felt needed to be answered.  **Thank you all again for your thoughtful and informative questions.  Even the ones that seemed off-putting at first, I think resulted in some good discussion.**  Good night!  I'll try to answer a few more in the days to come.  And I have seen your pm's and will get to those as well.  Please don't think I am ignoring you.

**Edit5:** I was on for a few hours today trying to answer any remaining questions.  Over 2000 questions and comments is a LOT to go through, lol!  I am working my way through the pm's you've all sent, but I am back to work tomorrow.  I have over 4 pages, so please be patient.  I promise to get to everyone!  
And not a huge Douglas Adams fan, but I just saw that the comments are exactly at 4242!"

I’ve made millions, lost it all, made it back, and written about everything I’ve learned along the way. AMA","Hi Reddit, my name is James Altucher. I’m an entrepreneur and writer. I’ve founded 20 companies, ranging from hedge funds to dating websites, most of which have failed. A few have made million dollar exits. I blew that on expensive toys, trips, and bad ideas, and saw my account go from $15 million to $143 in a matter of months. I lost my house, my friends, my sanity and considered killing myself. BusinessWeek called me “Wall Street’s keeper of pain”.

After a few months of depression and heartache, I started a blog to bleed out some of my ideas and lessons I was going through (to give you an idea, popular posts include “I Want My Kids to Be Drug Addicts”, “How I Screwed Yasser Arafat Out of $2 Million, and Lost $100 million”, and “I Want To Die”). I started more businesses, wrote more books. Now the blog receives millions of visitors a year, I made most my money back through new investments, and just published my new book: [Choose Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00CO8D3G4)

[Choose Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00CO8D3G4) is the result of everything I’ve gone through in the past. You can’t wait on anyone to give you the life you want. Nobody is coming to hire you, invest in your company, to sign you, to pick you. College isn’t going to help, neither are your parents, or friends. You have to choose yourself. There are more ways than ever to make a million dollars, create art, and change the world, without “help.” If you want to read it, I’ll even [pay you to do so](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2013/06/nobody-has-ever-made-this-offer-before-i-am-paying-people-back-if-they-read-my-book/)

IAmA Weed Scientist, AMA","I am the chemist and laboratory director of Steep Hill Lab, the nation's leading laboratory  for cannabis analysis. We do not produce or sell anything except for knowledge. We test submitted samples for cannabinoid and terpene potency, pesticides, trace residues, and fungal contamination. I was educated in biomedical engineering at a top tier school and over the past 6 years have read almost every scientific paper on the subject that I could get my hands on, from phenotypic expression in plants to endogenous cannabinoids and receptors. There is a great deal of confusion and misinformation surrounding cannabis outside of the laboratory, and I aim to correct that by answering your questions right here.

UPDATE: The website wasn't proof enough, so I sent reddit my business card this morning. Hopefully this post goes back online and we can keep this dialog going. To clarify, I have not been published as of yet. And I am not presenting any of my own research here. The purpose of this post is to dip into the huge trove of research that has been done in the past 10 years on cannabis and bring it to light, so that the public can make its own educated decision on the subject.

Check out this paper. It's all-inclusive and a good general introduction to cannabis facts ranging from plant compositions to biological effects of cannabinoids and terpenes:

**If anyone from the media wishes to contact me, please PM me on here and I will do a private Q&amp;A.**

 Hello all once again, doing another IAmA. Why? Well I don't really post that much on Reddit, mostly browse, so karma doesn't matter to me, especially in a self post. 

Anyway, so you may have all heard about Google StreetView's new update! I've been driving as a contracted driver for Google under a third-party company for about 3 months now. 

I have mostly been part of the update project since I started, I haven't really added *too* much to the new system, mostly just improving it and such as the update states. I did have an option to help with the UnderwaterView, but it would result in me having to pay all expenses to get there, don't really have the money to do so. After all, this job is a temp-job.

Anyway, right now I'm nearing the finishing of my routes in New England and then will be going a little west and south, going to about Virginia or so. I'm one of the lucky few who has been kept on due to my hard work (and them overworking me and me not complaining...money is money). 

So yeah, ask me anything. The only thing I can't answer is my current location or where I will be going and what route, due to my own safety. 

I did get into a minor fender bender with my van that I had, so they gave me one of the Imprezas to drive. I prefer this car much more, but it does behave a little topheavy in windy conditions.

528,IAmA,AMA Request: Chuck Palahniuk,"* What was the first thing you wrote that you were proud of?

* Which of your works is your favorite? Why?

* Where do you draw the most inspiration from?

* Are you happy with the film adaptations of your books? Is there anything you wish had been done differently to make the films more accurately represent the books and characters in them? Is there anything you feel was done in the films that really impressed you and you thought was an improvement from the books?

* You have spoken about your experiences that inspired the book Choke and that you attended meetings because you were transporting people to them. You've also written about support meetings elsewhere including Fight Club. Have you ever heard anything in a support group that stands out as a particularly inspiring, sad, or shocking memory?

This isn't a question just an aside but I really loved reading Testy Festy in Stranger than Fiction. I spent some time in Missoula and I was completely taken aback when I first learned about the festival. Reading about it as described by Palahniuk was a real treat.

I started as a pit clerk (pit boss's bitch, basically) two years ago and restrained myself from advancing in the industry because I thought I could find a job related to the major I graduated in. Nope. I learned enough there to be a supervisor without ever dealing.

They offered a dealer school, and I figured why the hell not. I've been dealing since February. However, I've dealt my own semi-serious private poker game for two years (currently on hiatus after an armed robbery... ugh) and I'm already mostly on every single game my casino offers, including Baccarat, Pai Gow Poker, pitch Blackjack, and training on Craps.

I spend an uncomfortable amount of time studying the inner workings and numbers behind gambling games, so I can chime in on those questions, too. Seriously, ask me questions about Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, flipping coins, the LOTTERY... anything. There are so many misconceptions and myths regarding gambling that I couldn't even fit them all into 100 pages of text. The mythology in casino culture is almost as powerful as that of a religion. I want to inform people!

We are here to discuss the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) which we are striving to reform, and under which Aaron Swartz, Andrew Auernheimer (weev), and others have been prosecuted and which potentially makes felons out of millions of Americans by criminalizing website terms of service violations.

We hail from across the political spectrum and we have somewhat divergent opinions about what the ideal CFAA would look like.  But we all agree that the CFAA allows law enforcement to engage in frivolous prosecutions and/or to seek penalties that are severely disproportionate to alleged offenses -- and that this stifles innovation and speech and must be fixed.

It hit #274 on Amazon yesterday ([proof](http://i.imgur.com/9QUcbde.png)), which blows my mind.

What I write about is pretty eclectic -- basically, what's something new to me and fascinating. Here are five very recent ones, to give you a taste:

* To help fight chlamydia, Sweden once set up an [on-demand condom delivery service](http://nowiknow.com/the-condom-express/) and had an awareness day called Chlamydia Monday.
* Colgate-Palmolive once pulled a snack off the shelves, allegedly because [it made people fart too much](http://nowiknow.com/the-musical-snack/). 
* Ever notice how, when you're on your cell phone and the call drops, you can almost immediately tell? That's because [cell phone companies pump artificial noise into the receiver](http://nowiknow.com/enjoy-the-silence/) specifically to make it clear that the other side is still there.
* In the 1700s, [people were killing children in order to get executed](http://nowiknow.com/the-worlds-worst-loophole/). Why? Because suicide would cause them to go to Hell, but they wanted to kill themselves.
* And a program in Brazil which gives prison inmates [time off for riding a stationary bike hooked up to a car battery](http://nowiknow.com/pedaling-to-freedom/). This charges the car battery, and the power is used to power street lights. (If anyone here writes for *Orange is the New Black*, this should totally happen.)

And [here's one which I think most of us on reddit suffer from](http://nowiknow.com/witzelsucht/)... especially me.

All the archives are [here](http://nowiknow.com/archives/) and you can subscribe for free. They're kind of random, but hopefully interesting.

I reached out the UC Davis Guantanamo Project and told my full story.  Since telling my story I have been threatened by the Government, harassed at work, and much more.

And aside from that, if this isn't done, be it because the moderator or users don't want it, be it because of technical difficulties or be it for whatever reason, I beg you people, stop downvoting the freaking answers, they are relevant and you know it, it's just outright immature."

557,IAmA,IamA 21-year-old girl who was disciplined for inappropriate touching at my job in an inner-city elementary school. AMA,"A year and a half ago, I worked for the YMCA's after school program, which took place in the poorest elementary school in the city.

The program, which was basically homework and then playtime, was for the kids whose parents couldn't afford daycare, and for the mostpart, wished they didn't have a kid. This was best proven by the fact that about 1/4 of the parents attended our free parents appreciation dinner, and 100% left early.

After I got to know the kids, they would run up to me and hug me to say hello, or sit on my lap during playtime.

I had the audacity to hug them back, and to read them stories while they climbed all over me.

This behavior earned me a write-up, and an incredibly offensive lecture about ""good touch, bad touch."" After all, if the parent sees, which they won't because they don't even look at their kids, they might sue us!

I was told that when a child hugs me, I am to walk away and ignore them in order to show them that touching is not okay.

I wasn't even allowed to hug the five year old who watched his dad get shot to death the night before. ""That's a matter for the mother to deal with,"" my boss said.

I called my mom, who's worked in childcare her whole life, expecting sympathy. But they had brainwashed her too. ""That's just how it is. Just don't touch them.""

I started hugging the kids more than ever, telling them how many things they could grow up to be, and then I quit. Rules like this make me sad about humanity, and I'll never stop wondering how those kids are doing.


Couple things: I wasn't a teacher, I was a part-time after school counselor while I went to college. I saw these kids for four hours a day, and I was never once alone with any of them. That rule is understandable, but I don't agree that hugging them in plain sight is any sort of threat.

But most of all, thanks for the front page! I'm pretty new here and I never expected anyone to care about my silly little AMA."

563,IAmA,"I quit my job, broke up with my long-time girlfriend, and then traveled the US by train for two months alone, staying only with random people I met off the internet days in advance. I made an AMA about it exactly a year ago today - and in it - I made you all a promise. I'm back. AMA!","A year ago today I made [this AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/imp9j/i_quit_my_job_ended_a_4yr_relationship_and_then/) about my chaotic adventure across the US by train, and spent the following weeks talking with redditors about what happened during my journey. The response was...*unexpected.* Psychologists, newspapers, magazines, college professors, and screenwriters approached me afterward trying to interview me, or write out my story. I answered question after question, and wrote email after email for weeks after my initial post, but when it came time to actually sell my story...I knew I couldn't. I'd made a promise to you all, and I have every intention of keeping it.

After a full year of writing and editing, I am finally able to say that I have completed the story of my travels. All of it, written out in detail from start to finish in the vein of an adventure book. Every chapter takes places in a different city, with different situations, and with different people. It's fair to say that each chapter is a mini-story in-and-of itself, and the whole trip ties it together. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to debate a US diplomat on Wikileaks, or to fall in love in Seattle, or maybe cross two state-lines following a fever-induced dream, getting sloshed on tequila with an overly aggressive 40yr old cougar and then wake up scared and alone, live on a train, or perhaps what it would be like finding yourself at knife-point in a dark and dingy train station near midnight...all of this is written in here, and more. This was the craziest period of my life (especially being introverted), and I'm more than happy to be able to share what happened, and what invaluable lessons I've learned because of it.

Here is my [prologue](http://www.elf-clan.com/ichosetherailsprologue.pdf) if you're interested (note:this is a *true* story, and so it contains some profanity), and below is the actual book if you want to read more...

* **[I Chose the Rails (Kindle)](http://www.amazon.com/I-Chose-the-Rails-ebook/dp/B008IW2AOQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341988366&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=i+chose+the+rails)** - I left the file open so you can convert and share with any/all devices.

If you guys have any questions about my trip, what it was like to going back to society, what it was like learning to become an author, self-publishing, writing a true story from memory and journals, or anything else... **AMA!!**

**EDIT** - This post, besides being dedicated to reddit, the IAMA community, and the [[two]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/u7ikn/inspired_by_a_fellow_redditor_i_put_my_life_on/) [[redditors]](http://traveltoallthethings.wordpress.com/) who traveled solo around the country because of reading my post, is dedicated to a person who I've never met, and yet, whose life I have somehow dramatically impacted. I received a message from him about three months after my OP, telling me that because of my AMA - he divorced his wife. 

I didn't really know how to respond, but I tried. 

Every day since then I've thought about that message, and tried to wrap my head around the fact that something I did/wrote could have had such an impact as to separate the bond of marriage within the lives of people I didn't even know. Wherever you are man, I hope you found the happiness you were looking for, and if it means anything, just know that your message has kept me going for the months that followed. The completion of this book, it's for you. If you could do something like that because of me, then I sure as hell could do something like this.

**EDIT** - Holy crap [it actually happened](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taADLPtyDb0)

**EDIT** - Thanks to Indolence for this link http://www.charitynavigator.org/ . Before voting for the charity you can see what they do with the money. Doctors without Borders looks like it's going to win, and National Space Society is a semi-close second. (In case you're wondering)

**EDIT** - Okay I've extended the paperback purchasing for 5 days total. To be honest, I can't wait for my brief moment in the spotlight to fade, it's unnerving and awkward. I made a promise to myself that I would write the book and then post about it. I've done that, I fulfilled what I was meant to do. Now, I need to start getting these orders processed, and then return to my quiet life. :) Thank you everyone for your support. If you have any more posts/questions I'll still answer them when I can.

566,IAmA,"I am Congressman Jim McGovern, sponsor of two constitutional amendments to overturn Citizens United and restore “We, the people.”  Ask Me Anything! ","Hello! I am Congressman Jim McGovern, from the 2nd Congressional District of Massachusetts. Over the past three years, I've been one of the leading voices in Congress to overturn the Supreme Court's misguided decision in Citizens United, which unleashed a flood of corporate and special interest money into the American political system. 

I recently introduced two constitutional amendments to that effect. The first amendment, HJ Res 20, advances the fundamental principle of political equality for all by empowering Congress and the States to regulate political spending.  It will allow Congress to pass campaign finance reform legislation that will withstand Constitutional challenges.    The second amendment, HJ Res 21, would overturn *Citizens United* and put a stop to the growing trend of corporations claiming first amendment rights.  This “People’s Rights Amendment” not only addresses corporate rights as they pertain to campaign finance, but is broader in scope to clarify that corporations are not people with Constitutional rights.  Importantly, the amendment clearly protects the people’s rights of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free exercise of religion, freedom of association, and all other such rights of the people. 

 ( [My floor speech on those two amendments is just about at 100K views on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5IEEv4RVIc) ) 

More on me: I dedicate a lot of my time in Congress to human rights and hunger issues as the co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission and the House Hunger Caucus.  I'm also the second ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee, and a member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, which has jurisdiction over SNAP, and other nutrition and consumer programs. 

 I'm a dad, a Red Sox fan, and proud to be from Worcester, MA.  Ask me anything!

UPDATE:  Thanks for joining me, everyone.  This was a lot of fun and I hopfully will get a chance to do it again.  Like I said, 10 years ago I never would have thought that a conversation like this would have been possible.

I was also in [Nightmare on Elm Street](http://i.imgur.com/uM37b.jpg), as well as [many other movies and shows](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0389003/).

These days, however, I find myself the victim of people in very high positions of power within the Hollywood Industry.  They have denied my health coverage, and I was hoping that through reddit I could share my story.

In the 80s, I was on the SAG Board of Directors, where I advocated for stunt people who not being recognized by the Board.  Even once my term was over, I continued to advocate for my fellow stunt people.  This was apparently an act the Board of Directors wouldn't forget.

Skipping ahead to the present day, many years in the stunt business has left me with multiple injuries, including Post-Concussion Syndrome and all its effects (which has recently been in the news linked to the death of Football player Junior Seau).  I applied for my health coverage through SAG, but they refused to cover me, refusing to acknowledge the PCS, despite the fact that I had been diagnosed as such by a doctor.

Now, I'm trying to get my story out there through reddit and the internet in the hopes that maybe someone can help me and others with injuries like mine get the rightful coverage we have earned.

So AMA, reddit, about my career as a stuntwoman, my injuries, or what [Ricardo Montalban is like in person](http://i.imgur.com/N6r96.jpg)!  After years of being an advocate for stunt people, I’m looking for someone who can help me now.

2. Throughout the series, we see Walter transform from someone looking out for his family, to something darker and more sinister. Is that because of creator Vince Gilligan's writing, or did you have input as to how you wanted Walter to transform throughout the series?

3. Whats your relationship with Aaron Paul like offset? Are you two practically bros?

586,IAmA,"IAMA Constitutional Lawyer - here to answer questions about Prop 8, DOMA, VRA, and Affirmative Action (and anything else about the Constitution or Supreme Court!)","Hello again!

I've got a pile of Qs on my old threads following yesterday's SSM decisions so, as promised, I'm back for the post-decision AMA. I'm around today save for a few meetings so I should be able to do Q&amp;A most of the day. 

Per usual, here's my regular intro.

**Quick Background:**


I'm a lawyer living and working in DC. My pet love my whole life has been the Constitution and constitutional law. I do not work as a constitutional lawyer for my day job, but I do write academically and colloquially about areas of constitutional law. I've worked in a public interest firm doing constitutional litigation in the past, so I can do some Q&amp;A about how that process works but I no longer actively litigate.

My areas of specialization are the First Amendment and legislative procedure. Within the First Amendment I know mostly speech/press/election law issues and legislative procedure is all about our federal legislative system (so everything from item-line veto to the filibuster) are what I love to talk and write about.

I have a general knowledge of most other constitutional provisions, including the issues surrounding same sex marriage, so ask away - I'll be as accurate as possible (and will point you to more knowledgeable folks if I can't answer your questions).

One caveat that I give in all my AMAs - I'm not great on national security law. I know the basics on issues of military tribunals, jurisdictional issues, war powers, and executive privilege but questions of indefinite detention, torture, GITMO, and drone strikes are pretty foreign to me. I highly recommend the [Lawfare Blog](http://lawfareblog.com/) for all national security law related interests. The writers there are fantastic and unbelievably knowledgeable.

I *do* know the Espionage Act through my First Amendment forays, so I can answer Snowden related questions there.

One more caveat - I'm happy to dig in to the 2nd Amendment but will warn in advance that I'm not fluent in it. I can discuss the decisions that set the rules but most folks want me to make arguments and, while I can throw together law school quality arguments, I'd hardly call myself an authority, so take any answers to 2A questions with a grain of salt. Happy to talk about the constitutionality of gun control legislation as I see it, but again, I'm not an authority on this one.

**DISCLAIMERS, IMPORTANT NOTES, AND LEGALESE**


Nothing contained herein is or should be construed as legal advice. This is purely informational and made for educational purposes. I'm here because I believe educating people about our system is the best way to engage folks in protecting and improving the system. I'm not here to be your lawyer, nor could I legally give you advice even if I wanted to.

Also, I do my absolute best to keep my politics out of my commentary and my answers. Where I am giving an opinion or my interpretation, I will note it as best I can. The law, like many things, has many interpretations - some good, some bad. Opinions on case law are diverse and I'm not here to present a single truth, in fact I will do my best to display the diversity of opinion around particular areas of law.

589,IAmA,"I am ""allergic"" to sexual arousal, AMA","I am a guy in my 20s. Ever since high school, I have had a condition called [chronic pelvic pain syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_prostatitis/chronic_pelvic_pain_syndrome). It’s essentially a constant ache in the pelvic/bladder area, just the way some people have chronic back pain or headaches. In my case it started gradually and without apparent cause.

A hallmark of this condition is that the pain gets [worse after orgasm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247725). I have this symptom too; in fact, over the years it has worsened to the point where **any sexual arousal (not just orgasm) can cause a flareup**. This can include such minor things as seeing a racy picture, having an attractive girl brush up against me, or simply thinking about a girl I like. This is as bad as it sounds. A few seconds or minutes of pleasure can result in hours, days, or weeks of increased pain.

I’ve tried, without success, every pelvic pain treatment in the book, from special diets, to physical therapy/stretching/relaxation regimens, to pain medications, to an implanted nerve stimulator. I have seen the very best urologists, neurologists, anesthesiologists, rheumatologists, physical therapists, psychiatrists, etc. All they can tell is that I probably have some rare disorder or injury to my autonomic or central nervous system.

So, the only way I have found to keep my pain from spiraling is to **strictly abstain from all sexual arousal**. This means no more sex, foreplay, kissing (or ANY romantic contact with women), or masturbation. No looking at women in a way that might arouse me (this means absolutely no porn, or even seeing women in revealing clothing). When an attractive girl walks by me on the street, I often have to avert my gaze to avoid getting aroused. And the most difficult part: no sexual thoughts. When I break these rules, I usually sorely regret it. The last time I had sex, I was in bad pain for over 2 weeks. So, I have not had sex (or masturbated, etc) in a very long time. My libido is high, so this requires every last bit of willpower I have.

Proof/evidence: I have scanned a few [excerpts](http://i.imgur.com/uzeqpzJ.png) from my medical records. Can post more if people are interested.

This condition causes me huge anguish. I feel I am in a mental prison, being starved emotionally. It’s tragic because before I got this condition, I was thriving in all aspects of my life and had huge ambitions that were cut short. I also went from having satisfying relationships with women, to hardly being able to date.

There are so many facets to this condition and its impact on my life, so rather than write everything out I’ll see what people want to know.

I’m putting this AMA out there because my rare condition and life situation may be of interest to some, and maybe some connections will be made that will someday help me or someone else.

**EDIT**: some FAQs:

- I have tried acupuncture, unsuccessfully.

591,IAmA,"I am Rachelle Friedman Chapman aka ""The Paralyzed Bride"". I am a 27 y/o quadriplegic. AMA","In the summer of 2010, at my bachelorette party, one of my best friends playfully pushed me into a pool. My head hit the bottom of the pool, and two of my vertebra shattered. The broken vertebra damaged my spinal cord enough to leave me permanently paralyzed from the chest down. At that moment, my world fell apart, but I stayed as positive as I could be. My fiance at the time(now husband) was away on a camping trip with his family. When he heard the news, he rushed to the hospital, and never once left my side. In the following year, we appeared on various media outlets and talk shows together. It's been a very exhausting but interesting 3 years. 

At this point, more than anything, i really would like to work and have a sustainable income. It's incredibly hard to find a job that is compatible with my situation. Constant nerve pain, mobility issues, etc. For the time being, I speak at churches, organizations, and other various groups. 

I love meeting and talking to new people. 
Please add me on twitter, facebook, etc. thanks!

592,IAmA,"I'm Rep Zoe Lofgren, Here is a Modified Draft Version of Aaron's Law Reflecting the Internet’s Input","Thank you, Reddit and everyone else who provided feedback to the [original](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/16njr9/im_rep_zoe_lofgren_im_introducing_aarons_law_to/) rough draft bill to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and the wire fraud statute – the laws the government used to unfairly prosecute Aaron Swartz.  With the help of Internet freedom advocates, computer and legal experts, [the draft has been revised and is available here.](http://www.lofgren.house.gov/images/stories/pdf/aarons%20law%20revised%20draft%20013013.pdf) I have been in communication with Aaron’s father who supports this draft bill and approves of the name “Aaron’s Law.”

Like the first draft, this revised draft explicitly excludes breaches of terms of service or user agreements as violations of the CFAA and wire fraud statute.  This revised draft also makes clear that changing one's MAC or IP address is not in itself a violation of the CFAA or wire fraud statute.  In addition, this draft limits the scope of CFAA by defining ""access without authorization"" as the circumvention of technological access barriers.  Taken together, the changes in this draft should prevent the kind of abusive prosecution directed at Aaron Swartz and would help protect other Internet users from outsized liability for everyday activity.  

As our discussions have continued, it is clear that many believe a thorough revision of the CFAA and substantial reform of copyright laws are necessary.  I agree.  “Aaron’s Law” is not this complete overhaul, but is a first step down the road to comprehensive reform.  If we succeed in getting this draft bill enacted into law, it will be in honor of Aaron Swartz, and should be seen as a beginning of a concerted effort to bring reform to these broader issues.  To be successful, that effort will likely take substantial time and require sustained and intense support from all of you in a push that will need to exceed our stoppage of SOPA.  
 
I see “Aaron’s Law” as common sense fixes that should be enacted to stop the kinds of abuse Aaron was subjected to from affecting others.  I intend to introduce a final version of ""Aaron's Law"" as legislation soon, and in talking with my friend Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, I understand he wants to introduce it in the Senate as well. I will be urging my colleagues in the House of Reps to become cosponsors. The chances of success – whether for ""Aaron's Law"" or other proposals – will depend greatly on the degree of positive public engagement and support to change the law.  As SOPA showed, when the Internet speaks, lawmakers listen.  I think with enough constructive support we can have an opportunity to pass ""Aaron's Law."" 

Many thanks to all of you – **Zoe**"
593,IAmA,"IAMA WWII Marine Corps Rifleman, Sterling Mace, and Author of Battleground Pacific: A Marine Rifleman's Combat Odyssey in K/3/5. AMA about the Battle of Peleliu.","Hi Reddit.  My name is Sterling Mace.  I served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1942-1945.  I am 88 years old.  I am also an author. http://us.macmillan.com/author/sterlingmace . My book came out on May 8th, 2012:  *Battleground Pacific: A Marine Rifleman's Combat Odyssey with K/3/5*, from St. Martin's Press. http://us.macmillan.com/battlegroundpacific/SterlingMace.

I would like to focus primarily on the battle of Peleliu, but other topics are free game, such as the Great Depression, growing up in Queens, New York in the 1930s...or anything Marine Corps related.

Ask me anything; I'm not shy.  I suppose almost anything, except for questions about Gene Sledge, who I didn't know very well since he was in the mortars and I was a rifleman at the front of the line. I'm sure he was a swell marine, but I didn't even have a chance to know him because the mortars were about 75-100 yards behind us on the line (a few other riflemen and I were consultants on his book, though, and you can find my name in the acknowledgment, for what it's worth – which isn't much).

Otherwise, I'm here for you.  Not for me.  It is my honor to be among you today.  If by educating, you somehow find in your hearts to honor those who never made it back, then my mission is complete.

Edits: Okay, I've been going a long time and I'm about half loopy on martinis.  I'm going to take a break and come back later if anybody is still interested.  Hell, you think you might be interested in another one of these a few months from now?

http://www.mtv.com/videos/pimp-my-ride-justins-97-toyota-rav4-full-episode-514/1567490/playlist.jhtml

-How long did it actually take them? 
Took 5 months to complete the car.

-Did you like what they did? 
At first, no. But I eventually got used to it. I also redid the whole car, added about $20,000 worth of things to it. You can see that [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gYVfNoJJE)

-Did all the stuff actually work? 
They actually take out a lot of the stuff that they showed on TV. Such as the ""pop-up"" champagne, and the ""drive-in"" theater.

 
-Do you still have the car? 
Unfortunately, due to some wiring errors (work done by a completely different shop), it burned. You can see it happen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-q6Y8nn1iA).

-How did you get selected?
It was a casting call at GAS. There were over 200 cars in the parking lot, auditioning. I was requested to go to a final audition with 15 other people. There, I made a video of the car, and from there, they sent it to the producers. A week later they called me back to start shooting. I was in competition with the other 15 contestants. So whoever made the best video would be the one getting their car pimped. In reality, it wasn't true. All of the other ""contestants"" got their rides pimped anyways.

About four months ago, five years of work in retail got to me and I quit. Working out of a bedroom with my friend and living off of pasta and bread with no other income, I focused my energies on bringing to Kickstarter a project that I'd been working on in my spare time - **Tangiers.** 
The risk of going into this was that had it failed, I would probably lose my house pretty soon after. Fortunatly we succeeded!

Tangiers is a pretty niche effort - a stealth game that's driven by a range of 20th century avant-garde reference points. Despite this, the fact that we're unnown and that we do not have a publically available build to download, we [managed to hit our target yesturday!](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1841885340/tangiers-surrealist-stealth)

633,IAmA,I have lost 180 Lbs Over the course of 2+ years.(390lbs - 210lbs) I am now a Certified Personal Trainer at the YMCA. AMA.,"Alright... Here it goes.
My whole life I have been a big person. I was teased as a kid, very cruelly... I never understood why I couldn't be left alone.. Even my family, teachers and doctors constantly made comments about my weight. So in order to be left alone, I tried hiding in plain sight. Ya know, made jokes about myself being fat, how I was ugly etc. 
But it just seemed to make things worse. I once in a rare occasion tried throwing up my own food. I hated who I was and I so desperately just wanted to change and love myself.

So I did.

I went on the internet, checked out books from the library, asked people who worked out regularly questions, and looked up tons of information about how the body works and what I can do to change, and if there truly was hope for me... Or if I was just a lost cause.
After I completely surrounded myself with as much knowledge as I possibly could, I constructed a diet and workout regimen to start out with. 
I lost 20 pounds very quickly at the start.
Soon I lost 40 pounds.. Then before I knew it 60 pounds had vanished.. 
By this time, the teasing and insults had turned to praise and compliments.
After months and months of intense training, eating healthy, and sticking to my goal... 

I made it... I'm 210.

I worked out at the YMCA pretty regularly and I knew the whole staff, so I was recommended by one of the trainers that I be put on staff. After a series of interviews, I was put on staff as a personal trainer. 
I couldn't believe it. Me... The fat kid everyone picked on, a personal trainer.

EDIT:  Alright.. So I tried answering a lot of the questions.. Theres just so many! So tell yo what, heres a few questions that were asked multiple times:

How old and how tall am I?: I'm 18 years old and I am 5'11.

How can you be certified? Are you certified? Yes, I am I have my ISSA certification and im certified through the YMCA

What have you learned out of this experience? Ive learned that there is no excuse. If you want to achieve something.. Do it. No one's going to hand ANYTHING to you on a silver plate.

Do you blame your parents? No, I blame the fact that no information was given to them about healthy lifestyles. And I blame myself for not doing this sooner. 

Does your skin bother you? I get self conscious at times, but hey. Dont we all?

How's the love life? Great! I got the girl of my dreams.

How can I do this? Ive said it before and i'll say it again.. Be your own Personal Trainer! Be responsoble for youself, and prioritize whats important to you. You have the power to do anything.. I mean look at me. I was just some fat kid a few years ago.

638,IAmA,[AMA Request] Mikhail Gorbachev - The last General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,"* You have criticised the undemocratic nature of the current Russian government, how do you see this situation being rectified? 

* Following the 1991 coup, Russia underwent radical reforms that were outside of your control. Looking back do you think these were for the best, and if not which direction would you have preferred to take the Soviet Union?

* How much free reign did the KGB have?

* Can socialism work in the 21st century, and if so, how?

* You met many great statesmen and women in your time, were there any characters that really stood out as exceptional or different?

I posted this request after seeing [Born in the USSR's](http://www.reddit.com/user/born_in_ussr) [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rf9s/i_grew_up_in_the_soviet_union_during_the_cold_war/) about growing up in the soviet union. I think having a chance to talk to the man who oversaw both the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war would be a fascinating historical insight.

EDIT: I just sent this email to a few related organisations, now we wait I guess.

To who it may concern,

Hello, my name is X. I am a student in my first year of university with a keen interest in international politics and sustainable development. I am also an active member of one of the largest user driven internet forums in the world, Reddit. The site is divided up into many discreet sections (sub-reddits) that focus on different areas of interest. One of these sections, IAMA, is designed for users to be able to directly ask questions to notable public figures.
The style is that of an open forum, where a comment’s visibility is determined by the amount of positive or negative votes that other users give it. This process means that the most relevant and interesting questions will float to the top of the thread to be answered by the public figure. Such public figures have included:

President Barack Obama

Former Vice President Al Gore

Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger

…and many more

But not all of these AMA threads (Ask Me Anything) are authored by big names. There was recently a fascinating thread posted by a former citizen of the USSR, he described in detail what life was like under Communist Rule, and mused on the ideas of how things have changed. After the success of this particular Q&amp;A session I thought how interesting it would be to hear how the country was run from the man who at one point ran it.
So this is why I am sending this email, today I posted an AMA request for Mikhail Gorbachev on Reddit. It is currently one of the most popular posts in the IAMA section. I, and the other users of the site, would be extremely grateful to have the chance to directly talk to the man who was active in the very highest levels of the Soviet Union. Reddit has a user base in the tens of millions, and an “Ask Me Anything” thread by Mr Gorbachev would be a fantastic opportunity to spread his ideas and experiences with a huge amount of people. It would also be a fabulous historical experience for younger users to be able to directly talk to the last leader of the Soviet Union.

I am not sure exactly who this message will reach, but if you have a chance to put the idea to Mr. Gorbachev, please let me know if he would like to partake in a Q&amp;A session like the ones posted above. I hope you are in agreement with me when I say that this would be a great experience for all involved.

Looking forward to your response,

Kind Regards,

X

Здравствуйте,
Меня зовут X, я студент первого курса и очень увлекаюсь международной политикой и устойчивым экономическим развитием. Также я - активный член одного из крупнейших интернет-форумов в мире, Reddit. Это веб-сайт разделён на несколько разделов (под-reddit), фокусирующихся на разных областях интересов. Один из этих разделов, IAMA, придуман специально для того, чтобы пользователи могли в письменной форме задать вопросы напрямую выдающимся общественным деятелям. Это происходит в стиле открытого форума, где заметность вопроса пользователя определяется количеством положительных или отрицательных голосов, полученных от других пользователей. Этот процесс приводит к тому, что самые существенные и интересные вопросы появляются вверху всей дискуссии, чтобы быть замеченными и получить письменный ответ от общественного деятеля. Среди таких деятелей уже были:

Президент США Барак Обама,

Бывший вице-президент Эл Гор,

Губернатор Калифорнии Арнольд Шварценеггер,

...и многие другие.

Но не все AMA-дискуссии (от ""Ask Me Anything"" - ""спрашивайте меня что угодно"") начаты известными людьми. Не так давно удивительная и очень интересная дискуссия была начата одним из бывших граждан СССР. В ней он детально описывал, какова была жизнь при коммунизме, и размышлял о том, как всё изменилось. Именно после успеха этой дискуссии я подумал, как интересно было бы услышать о том, как управлялось это государство, от человека, который сам им управлял. Вот почему я пишу это письмо - сегодня я создал AMA-запрос на Reddit, предложение провести такую дискуссию для Михаила Горбачёва. В данный момент это один из популярнейших запросов в разделе IAMA. Я, как и другие пользователи этого веб-сайта, был бы в высшей степени благодарен иметь возможность напрямую пообщаться с человеком, действовавшим на самых высоких уровнях Советского Союза. Количество пользователей Reddit исчисляется десятками миллионов, и ""Ask Me Anything""-дискуссия господина Горбачёва была бы фантастической возможностью поделиться его идеями и опытом с огромным количеством людей. А возможность напрямую пообщаться с последним лидером Советского Союза была бы изумительным историческим переживанием для молодых пользователей Reddit.

Я не вполне уверен, кому именно придёт это сообщение, но если у Вас есть возможность донести эту идею до господина Горбачёва, пожалуйста, сообщите мне, хотел ли бы он принять участие в такой дискуссии в виде вопросов и ответов, как описано выше. Я надеюсь, Вы согласитесь со мной в том, что это было бы замечательным опытом для всех участников.

С нетерпением жду ответа,

С наилучшими пожеланиями,

X"
639,IAmA,IAMA 32 y/o who grew up stereo blind. Two years ago I had surgery that enabled me to see 3D for the first time in my life. AMA,"My folks thought I had a lazy eye when I was a kid. I too had to wear the eye patch of shame. (It did come in handy as a respirator when carving pumpkins...) I knew that I didn't see like everyone else, but I never knew that there was a possible treatment for it. My vision basically worked by trading dominant eyes depending on which direction I was looking. If I looked to the far left, my right eye would take over and the left one would kind of go into a standby mode where the whole field of vision it took in was like peripheral vision. If I looked to the far right, my eyes would seamlessly trade rolls. I could voluntarily switch which one was dominant, but they couldn't work at the same time. I had what is known as esotropia. I had very mildly crossed eyes. The surgery fixed everything overnight."

P.S: i didnt mean to refer to the donors with ""it"" to objectify them, it just got lost in translation and i ve been corrected. another thing, i haven't heard about doctors making less of an effort to heal donors before, guess is an american thing or just an urban legend, don't see how a doctor could do that to a patient and the diagnostic criteria is really hard to meet with absolutly no false positive reported in the litarature yet. Give me some time and i will answer your questions, if i dont answer to you directly is because it was asked before you came in and i recomend you read all the comments, thanks for all the support and nice questions, this has been a great oportunity to talk to patients and nice people, thanks.

EDIT 6: am kind of surprised that some people are judging my surgical skills based on my command of the english language, you are going like""ok, he just told how to perform a repair of a transposition of the great vessels in 2 min, but am calling bullshit because he spelled putrid wrong, come on guys! Am also on an iphone...

EDIT 7: a lot of comments about zolpidem's new found ability to improve patients with brain injuries, i doubt this would work in organ donors that are brain dead, if you dont get blood to your brain you couldn't get a drug to your brain either. its intresting but there still evidence to be obtained and it needs to be peer-rewieved before we find out if it really works. also now days everybody is a especialist and decissions are made by a multidiciplinary team, the surgeon can't know everything and make every decission, thats what the rest of the team are for, and i am sure that when and if zolpidem's ability is well stablished the neurophysiologist in my team would be aware of it as i am aware of new surgical techniques they don't know about yet.

EDIT 8: hey everybody...nods are actually knots

EDIT 9: no longer relevant things

EDIT 10: thanks for being here, hope i could make some people aware that donors are needed, become a donor if you wish something good to come from something bad, try to make a difference in someone elses life. You have a big problem in USA and most countries in E.U were people don't want to become donors and patients have to be implanted with machines for long periods of time and poor quality of life and high risk of complications. This two AMAs have been an intent to bring closer to the people this problem and the people involved in it and humanize the surgeons and other personal involved, know that we feel about you but are glad an happy that together we can help many people out there that really need help. Thanks for asking questions and good bye.

EDIT 11: for last i want to adress the title of the AMA since i have gotten well deserved comments claiming that the title is missleading since braindead patients are considered dead in medical terms even if their organs keep working with life support and drugs. First i apologize if this confussed you or made you feel bad in anyway. but thinking about it i think someone would allways have a problem with this AMA no matter what its name was. WHY? you ask, lets see, if a called it ""i collect or harvest or procure organs from dead donors"" (that would be the pragmatic medical definition), when people found out they were brain dead, some people would eventually comment they still have some life in them, no matter what the correct definition of brain death is, and they wouldn't be completly wrong. if it was called ""i harvest hearts from brain dead patients"" it would have been probably be the more suitable name, but similar debates would have happen. i picked the title that i taught best described what i wanted to get across the room and that is that this patients hearts are beating and they still have vital signs, and their organs are working in their majority. I also wanted to get across that this is the only case in witch you can legally do something to a patient that would directly end all vital signs and advancing or precipitating the patients death, i just don't take them off life support and wait for the inevitable to happen on its own, we in an active manner stop this people's hearts and end the activity of all remaining organs and make the patients unable to live even on lifesupport like they did before. maybe i could have chosen a more suitable title? probably yes, but what i could'nt have done was picking a title that wouldn't cause commotion or controversy. i suggest if you are intrested you read the whole AMA because all remaing questions are answerd and clarified inside. you can keep posting questions if you are not satisfied, i will continue to answer them as long as reddit allows me to keep posting here. thanks and bye

We started last Thursday night, when I was too tired to go on:

Then, we found out my ICD was malfunctioning and got it fixed:
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uy25t/iama_the_43_year_old_terminally_ill_husband_and/

And because my heart appeared to be getting stronger, that brought us to yesterday.
I went into the hospital to have an echocardiogram done.  Much like an ultrasound, they examine my chest with a transducer and take measurements to determine how much blood my heart is pumping, which led to the tech saying:  ""What did they tell you your ejection fraction was?""  I told him ""It was 10%, then 20-30, then back to 20 for a long time.""  The tech then said ""Well, I gotta tell you, I'm seeing it being much better here, but we'll wait for the doctor to look at it and determine the final numbers.""  That report hasn't come back yet.
They then sent me to radiology, where I was injected with a radioactive tracer for another test.  After sitting in a wheelchair for a while, I was taken for a cardiac stress test.  It did not go well.  I was given a drug that was supposed to stress my heart so they could take readings on how it performs.  Some people have a reaction to this drug.  I...am one of them.  I began vomiting violently.  Someone held me upright while another person put a basin in front of my mouth.  The doctor started calling out times, and someone kept taking my blood pressure.  I was not hearing good numbers, but was too busy trying to stay conscious, and vomiting constantly.  Eventually, I think a year later, the doctor said ""I'm going to give you the antidote now.""  WTF?  The antidote...now????  After they put it in my IV, I stopped vomiting, but felt as well as you can imagine.
Here are the results of that test:
Protocol Lexiscan
Time In Exercise Phase 30 S
Max Heart Rate 97 BPM
Max Predicted Heart Rate 177 BPM
Max. Systolic BP 142 mmHg
Max Diastolic BP 64 mmHg
Max Work Load 10
Symptom:   Negative -  Hypotensive Response
ECG:   Negative
Chronotropic Response:   Abnormal
Pretest Probability:   Intermediate
I have not one clue what any of it means.  All I understand is ""hypotensive"" and ""abnormal.""
So they took me back and almost immediately began the nuclear scan.  Cool, I laid there, some huge machine made a lot of noise and moved around a lot, and then I was told to rest, don't be around pregnant women, small kids, the elderly, and not get angry, because no one would like it when I was angry (the last is my own embellishment.)
These are the results of that test:
1. Left ventricular ejection fraction of 49%, just below normal limits.
2. No reversible perfusion defects identified to suggest stress-induced 
myocardial ischemia. 
3. Small fixed apical defect which may relate to physiologic apical 
thinning versus myocardial scar.
In case anybody missed it, my ejection fraction is now **49%**.  49.2, to be exact.  *My heart has more than doubled it's function, *  **and is now just below normal limits.**

I have spent the day speaking with my cardiologist, who confirms this is ""a miracle.""  That it testifies to the viral nature of my heart damage, but it's healing now, after so much time, to be nigh impossible.  They have reduced one of my cardiac meds, my carvedilol, by half.  I have been told I can start light exercise.  It was offered that my ICD could be removed if I wanted, *because I don't need it anymore.*

This will be my last post as thatdyingguy.  Because I'm not.  Despite coming to the end of my rope; of nearly letting go...in eight days, my life has been given back to me.  I'm crying as I type this now.  I still have CHF.  That's not good.  But...this.  This!  My son and daughters will keep their father.  My wife will keep her husband.  I no longer have to fear a loud noise, or eating something with cholesterol or caffeine.  We're going to have a lobster dinner tonight (if my arteries clogged at all, I was told I would be dead.  Period.) to celebrate.  I am going to sleep tonight, not in fear of dying, but in hope of what tomorrow can bring.  I troubled about spamming Reddit for the third time in a week.  I was told by my friend Aubrey to post.  That soooo many people were drawing hope from my story, that they would be blown away by what has happened.  I hope you are, because I certainly am.  Don't ever, *ever*, **ever** lose hope.  Any of you.

Edit:  to correct my spelling and punctuation because of tears in my eyes.

Edit 2, the Wrath of Khan:  I had to go talk to friends and family all afternoon and am going to be going to dinner soon.  I will try to get to everybody.  I swear it.  Also, I can't believe that right now, at this moment, I am ahead of MC Frontalot, who is one of my favorite rappers.  Listen to his stuff!  It is often mistaken for novelty music, but it is not.  :)  

Edit 3:  Going to dinner!  Back later or tomorrow, depending on how happy my wife is tonight.

Edit 4:  The last you'll hear from thatdyingguy:  A lot of people have drawn hope from my story, but it's still being written.  I have CHF, which means my diet, my fluids, everything will have to be monitored for the rest of my life, and will likely be what kills me.  Even though my heart has apparently been strong for some time, I am getting weaker.  I don't know if that's because of the strain on my entire heart, or maybe the extra weight...I don't know.  All I know is some days I can't get out of bed, I'm so weak.  I have pain all the time, still, even with an increase in my ejection fraction.  I am not well.  I am still very,very sick.  I may still die, and very soon.  But I beat viral cardiomyopathy.  And that's a fact.  I wish I could answer the rest of you.  But thatdyingguy is going away.  Good luck to all of you.  Love each other.  Take care of each other.  Look at each day and find something bright in it.  Goodbye."
668,IAmA,I stabbed a man in self-defense. AMA.,"Last October, a couple of friends and I went to a bar to celebrate a friend's birthday. After that was over we hit a different bar to keep the party going. We stayed there til they stopped serving alcohol. On our way out, we were confronted by a group of 7-8 guys who said one of us mugged them. We tried to talk it out but they wouldnt have it. A fight broke out and they ganged up on my best friend while our other friend and I tried to get them off him. They beat him into a bloody mess. When they finished with him they shifted their rage to the next closest target: me. Before they could jump me I remembered I had my EDC Kershaw knife on me(3.5 inch blade, clipped to my front pocket). Without hesitation I pulled it out and struck the first one of them that attacked me. The fight ended immediately. In the chaos that ensued, I tried to gather my group and get them into my car to make a get away. The police showed up almost immediately. A cop spotted my friend in my backseat covered in blood and stopped us at gun point. I was arrested and confessed to the stabbing. AMA. Proof:http://i.imgur.com/fbAX2rD.jpg?1

**Edit: Thanks everyone for all the questions. Keep them coming. I'll answer any and all additional questions tomorrow after work. Sleep time :) Remember, Don't give the cops ANYTHING when being arrested.**

**Ok, Im back and woah! so many up/down votes and comments! For everyone that keeps asking why I had a knife in the first place, heres a wiki on EDC, Every Day Carry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_day_carry**

FAQ:
This happened in East San Jose in California.  
I was 24. I am 25 now.  
The knife was a legal(in my county, anyway) 3.5 inch blade Kershaw Crown.  
The knife was ordered to be destroyed.  
I payed about $5,000. for bail and other expenses.  
The attackers were NOT charged or even arrested. I dont know why. Truthfully, I no longer care.  
I dont have an opinion on gun control, the Zimmerman case, the CA or US justice system.  
I was arrested because I confessed to stabbing a man. The police dont judge the event. That happens in court.  
He did NOT die.  
I stabbed him just left of his belly button.

As well as looking at these towns we also explored China's relationship to copying in other fields. This meant we visited the Dafen Oil Painting Village (where 60% of the world's fake masters are produced), many shanzhai selling stores, an abandoned Disneyland-esque theme park, and we also interviewed Ai Weiwei.

**Edit:** Disclaimer/Explanation. Ian is a close relative of mine, he (as others have done in the past iirc) did the AMA 'through' me, he wasn't directly typing the questions in himself but he was reading them himself and responding, responses which I then typed into the AMA the mods told me I could do this prior and it's also what he wanted to do. I thought that AMA's typically only lasted for ~1hour/1.5 hours and had no idea it was expected to go on for quite a bit longer than that.  Due to time he (or I) couldn't attend for that long, had I known I probably would have waited for sometime later next month when he was more likely to have time available. So in this case; please DO shoot the messenger as the slight confusion was all my fault, I probably should have educated myself on AMAs before pitching the idea to him.

697,IAmA,[AMA Request] Stephen King,"Big fan especially of the Dark Tower series. Would love to be able to pick the mans brain for a bit.

[1] It has been hinted at and teased for a long while but how do you feel about the possibility of The Dark Tower series getting the Game of Thrones treatment?

[2]Is there more of yourself in Roland or Eddie?

[3]How's the hip doing? Do you still take walks or are they more of the Stationary Bike type now?

[4]How many books do you feel you still have in you that will reach us the constant (and faithful) reader?

[5]You are my second favorite narrator of your stories (second only to the late Frank Muller.) Is it weird to read your own stories and how long does it take to record a novel? are there multiple takes?

Thankee Sai for your consideration, long days and pleasant nights."

699,IAmA,"IAmA an 84-year-old scientist who worked on some of the first computers, classified projects for the gov't during the cold war, early computer speech synthesis and analysis, and robotics. AMA.","Hi! This is an AMA for my 84-year-old grandfather, who worked at Bell Labs in New Jersey from the 60s to the late 90s as an scientist/electrical engineer/acoustics engineer. While he was there, he worked on a classified (not anymore!) Soviet submarine-tracking program for the gov't, worked with very early computers, and did work in early speech analysis/synthesis and robotics. I figured Reddit might be interested in asking him some questions... I'll put my comments on his responses in [square brackets] P.S. I'm not sure how to verify this...if a mod can suggest something to me, that would be great!
EDIT: All right, it's getting close to 9 PM and he's heading to bed. Thanks so much everybody for your interest! I'll maybe try and get him to answer any questions left on here overnight in the morning.
EDIT 2: Holy balls, I just checked this again and it went from 40 upvotes and 30 comments to 1,200 upvotes and 250 comments in the two hours since he went to bed. I'm gonna try and continue some of this tomorrow morning, and I'm also going to see what state his quasi-memoirs of working there are in. Last I saw he had written up quite a bit of cool stuff...and rather than e-mail it out to a million people, maybe I can upload it to a site and post the link. Thanks again to everyone who posted here and said kind words about him! I'll also try and send some proof to the mods for those who asked for it.
EDIT 3: It's so frustrating to see all these interesting questions come in and not be able to ask him! If people stick around until tomorrow morning I promise I'll do my best to get some more out of him.

FAQs:

1) Boy scouts look good. Eagle scout looks better. I don't like the boy scouts personally, but I like what you've likely gained as a result of your experiences with them. 

2) For home schooled applicants, we typically look more at standardized test grades such as the SAT, ACT, SAT II, AP, etc.

3) I'm not going to tell you which school I work for, sorry!

4) If your school doesn't offer X amounts of APs, we'll know that when your school sends us a secondary school report, so dont worry. If your school offers 2, for example, and you took both, we'll see that as ""Oh, he/she did all the rigorous work he/she could""

5) Your 5,000 hours of community service look good, don't worry

719,IAmA,Hello.  This is Fred Armisen.  Testing one two.,"Hi!  I am going to try to answer questions.  I'll try.  Here are some I saw already:

-What was your main inspiration for Portlandia?
Working on projects with Carrie.  That turned into making videos which then turned into the show.  Our surroundings in Portland became the setting.
-How much of your material do you write for your SNL skits?
I write with other writers there.  It's the most fun, getting to collaborate with smart and funny people.
-Is it amazing playing the most well-known parody of the President?
I love doing it.  
-Are most Portlandia characters based on people you've met?
For some reason, it's the other way around.  We make people up, then somehow we see them walking around.  Or biking around.
-Who have been the best hosts on SNL while you've been on the show?
So many and for different reasons.  I like ex-SNL cast members.  Like, Molly Shannon for example.  I get star struck.  I watched them on this show.

If you wouldn't mind, and if you feel it's appropriate, could you tell us a little bit about your own religious journey, and if your studies impacted your faith along the way?

When you accepted the Fox interview, knowing the networks content and typical biases, did you know that you were in for a one sided, heated debate?  Did you take exception to anything you were asked or accused of in particular?

Do you have any words to preface your book ""Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth"" for someone who plans to read it but hasn't yet?

You said in the interview you have extensive citations, how long did it take you to prepare for this book, and what was the most difficult part in the writing of it?

I won multiple National Championships in wrestling... Then at 19yo I started fighting professionally...

In the last year and a half I've gone DEEP in the Congo jungle to spend two months with the Mbuti Pygmy people... Maybe the most despised people group on the planet. Pygmy translated to some means ""Elbow Height"" because their men stand ONLY 4 foot 7 on average. In recent years some of the tribe has been hunted, killed, cooked, and eaten. The UN confirmed it, BBC, The Guardian, and CNN reported it. Then in August &amp; September of 2012 I partnered with the oldest university in Congo and their School of Community Development. What I didn't know, was their last EIGHT years of negotiations was about to pay off... BIG! 

We saw 60 Pygmy men, women, and children SLAVES be set FREE! Placed on their own land, that they own, for the FIRST time in history. We got an agriculturalist from the school to stay and teach the oldest nomadic, hunter gatherer tribe on the planet how to farm. Since then a ripple effect has occurred. We have seen over 120 slaves be set FREE on 60 acres of land and they are getting ready for their SECOND harvest! Now I have been made family with the tribe... They named me Efeosa, meaning: ""The Man Who Loves Us."" I'm getting ready to leave for the Congo jungle for a full year. ***Now I have decided to really get some skin in the game and put my life on the line.*** 

I will sleep in twig and leaf huts, sleep on the dirt, and when it rains in the rainforest I will sink into the mud like my last trip. (huts http://i.imgur.com/8RD1PKV.jpg) The Congolese University and my goal is to see 1,000 slaves be set FREE and DEVELOPED into a fully self-sustainable people on hundreds of acres of land. It's multi purposed 1.Slave Liberation 2. Rainforest Preservation and 3. Wildlife Conservation all while conserving their highly valued and near extinct culture. I want to leave room for questions...

FINAL EDIT: WHOA! This is insane. I can barely keep up. Been going for five hours now. I am sorry if I missed your question. They come in faster than i can reload and answer. 
I will keep this thread alive throughout the week and answer the stragglers as I have time. Thanks again so much for this. Reddit is my favorite internet hangout.  
Also....I'm always around reddit so now that we've all gotten to be such close friends feel free to say hello any time. 


BEST THING SO FAR FROM THIS AMA: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/x4rvy/iama_former_playboy_model_turned_hardcore_adult/c5j9tgx

EDIT 1: Holy balls! Sooooo many Q's! I promise they will all get A'd before the day is over. It's overwhelming but i'l push through. I'll take a short break soon and eat and then post some pictures. 

EDIT 2: I didn't mean I was taking a break NOW....jeez....I'm still going strong. Also....if you want pictures I have to take a break eventually to take the pictures. Don't worry...we'll have it all today! Fun times. Everyone just stay cool and remember: We're all friends here to have fun. :)

EDIT 3: Yes, I play video games. Yes, I have favorites, such as: BIOSHOCK (all of them), DARKNESS II, SKYRIM, SAINTS ROW 3, SILENT HILL (all of them, some more than others), BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY, MARIO KART, CoD (all of them...and yes, I'll beat your ass.)

EDIT 4: What do my parents/friends/family think of my career choices: My Mom knows but we don't discuss it. She's supportive though. My Dad knows I do nude modelling but it's too awkward to discuss any more than that. He's also very loving and supportive. No one has cut me off or been nasty to me as a result of my career choices. 

EDIT 5: How do I feel about the negative/bad/degrading parts of the industry: I've chosen to do (mostly) only videos that don't oppress or degrade women. It's been a conscious choice and while I have done some things that I know don't follow the above sentiment, I've done those mostly to appease multiple requests from fans. The fans make a career possible so I like to accommodate when I can. 
Do I think it's a job for every girl? Hell no. You have to be very strong willed to not succumb to the obvious pressures you'll get some everyone in the industry.
I have so many conflicting thoughts on this....it's one of the main topics I hope to address if I ever get a podcast up and running. 

EDIT 6: No, I won't tell you how much money I make....it's not polite to discuss numbers. 

EDIT 7: Favorite Doctor Who? Was Tennant but since I've met and partied with Matt Smith he's that top of my list. What a wonderful guy he was. 

EDIT 8: Does size matter? Anything 5 inches or over is perfectly fine. 9 inches and up is too big. Girth matters most. Small and thick is a lot better than 30 inches long and thin as a pencil. "
724,IAmA,I got my anonymous cyberstalker of 1.5 years arrested for harassing me and threatening to shoot up the college where I teach. AMA!,"Hey Reddit!


As this case is still going through the court system, I prefer to remain as anonymous as possible. I sent proof to the mods by showing my ID, a copy of my Order of Protection, a copy of a syllabus I used as a college adjunct, and a screen shot of my stalker's charges that were posted online. [They've verified this proof](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hkeok/i_got_my_anonymous_cyberstalker_of_15_years/cav6qj2) and you can also quasi-verify by checking out the posts I made about this [in r/askreddit one year ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s9va3/ive_been_cyberstalked_for_8_months_police_wont/) and [in r/privacy when I was in the midst of everything just a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1889gy/i_want_to_identify_my_psychoticviolent/).

**The basic story:**

I'm a female adjunct professor who TA'd for a course 2 years ago. That summer I received disturbing, violent, suicidal, and affectionate text messages from an unknown number. This soon progressed to email messages, facebook messages, and then every social networking site I was connected to. The more I blocked the incoming messages or deleted myself off the internet, the more the stalker persisted and found new ways to get to me, e.g. by emailing and facebook messaging/stalking my roommate, close friends and family and threatening to kill them if I didn't come back online or respond. The stalker soon learned of my home address, my family's home address, and threatened to physically harm me by coming to my apartment, tying a rope around my neck, and ""taking me away.""


I continued monitoring just my old inactive facebook account to keep the stalker preoccupied. Eventually, the stalker got sloppy and started sending me messages about college course-related information. I did my own investigative work with this information and worked with my college to identify the stalker as a former student of mine from a course I TA'd in 2011. The college called her in for a meeting to discuss her academic standing, my case, and other behavior issues she was having, but she was difficult and refused to attend. In the meantime, she, the stalker, sent me a message saying that she wanted to ""shoot up"" the school and discussed how she was going to steal her uncle's guns so that she could come and do it when she came in for the meeting. I informed me school and my detective and she was arrested. She spent 2 nights in jail, was ROR'd, and me and my roommate were given orders of protection.



AMA, and I'm just sitting at a desk all day today so I can answer questions all day long.

Here are some things I'd love to talk about:

- more details/particulars about my stalker's behavior, about the case, and my experience with it all
- anonymity/privacy on the internet
- the actual privacy level of social networking sites
- the law around stalking and harassment / privacy
- police mentality around these cases
- tracking a stalker: personal and legal documentation/reporting


**Edit:** Hey guys! Loving all your questions - and I'm still here (12:26 PM EST). Keep 'em coming. I'll get to as many as I can!

**Edit 2:** Wow guys, so many good questions. I wish I could get to you all. I will try to answer them over the next couple of days too if I don't get to yours. Also, there are a lot of repeat questions! So please look at my user page to see the responses I have already given to make it easier to track what's been asked/said. I'm still here answering (1:39 PM EST). Also, just a few points/clarifications:

**Edit 3:** Still here (3:00 PM EST). I'm out at 6:00 though! And will try to answer as many as I can in the next few days. Thanks for all your questions everyone. And the PMs - Glad to hear all your stories and offer my support/advice!

**Edit 4:** Done for the day everyone. I'll keep checking this to try to get to any more questions in the next couple days, as promised. Thanks again for all of your great questions. I will update when I have more on the sentencing.

*Why would I do this AMA if the case is ongoing?* - A news reporter recently wanted to run a story on this case. I refused to comment because I didn't want it to get misinterpreted and I didn't want my name to be attached to my comments (for my stalker to easily find/see). Instead I'm taking my story into my own hands and using as a moment to educate anonymously. Yes, an AMA is very public and potentially risky (although my identity is nowhere here), but I am willing to take the risk if it means informing people about this topic. This is an issue that can potentially affect everyone. I did nothing to intentionally provoke my stalker and that is the case for most stalking cases. My number one goal is to help others going through this or help prevent it from happening to YOU. I hope it proves useful.

*What's next?* - Some people have requested I update you when she goes to court and is actually sentenced. I promise to do that. But it might be a while - sometimes these cases take years."

Recently I have learned a bit more about it I thought I would make an AMA for anyone curious about having to live with something like this. I cannot really tell you much about the disorder as besides a knee surgery when I was younger to even out leg bone growth, I have never seen a specialist to see if there is anything that can be done about it.

My body is split right down the middle with the left side being larger than the right in every way. Bone growth, muscle layer, fat layer, finger length, even my nether bits.

Some pictures are nsfw but no full body nudity. Please note I am fat and it just makes it a bit more extreme.

I can provide more pictures if requested. The one this I ask of you reddit is please don't tell me to lose weight. I have lost quite a bit yet it only comes off of the right side. I'm still trying.

Other than that ask anything you want. And if anyone knows of a specialist I would appreciate any info.

737,IAmA,I’m a British man who’s taken road trips covering all but 8 of the Contiguous US with many stops in between to have fun and learn about the USA - AMA,"Over the last few years I’ve been renting cars or getting rides with friends to see as much of the USA by road as possible,  I just sat down and worked out which states I’m ‘missing’ and I’ve only got Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Rhode Island left to see (though I’ve been to many places multiple times and I know there’ll always be new stuff to go explore so this isn’t really a list-checking exercise).  I’ve stayed in a bunch of different cities with a lot of repeat visits and loved most of them, had mixed feelings about some and didn’t much care for one (Miami). I’ve visited a bunch of National Parks, National Monuments and a few State Parks. I’ve been snowboarding in the Appalachian Mountains, desert hiking in Moab and kayaking in the Everglades. I also once flew a small plane over Seattle/Puget Sound which was kind of scary. I’ve been in swing states for Presidential elections, New Orleans just before Katrina hit and New York a few weeks after 9/11. I’ve eaten ludicrous meals, including several things that shouldn’t have been deep-fried, across the country that I’m sure have taken years off of my life and I’ve met a whole range of lovely people (and a few unpleasant ones) from all walks of life across the USA.

I’m happy to answer questions about what I’ve done, who I’ve met, my views and experiences of the USA, my favourite/least favourite States or whatever else you might come up with. I’ve also travelled a fair bit around Asia, Europe and a bit of Africa and the Middle East so I could also make some global comparisons rather than just comparing everything to the UK if that’s something people are interested in.

739,IAmA,"AMA I sold my eggs for $30,000.","At the end of last year I sold my eggs for $30,000.

It was actually a pretty long process. I saw a facebook (!) ad promising $30,000+ for an egg donor (thought it was surely a scam, but didn't want to do homework). I was selected by the future parent(s). The application process involved mini-essays on how I dealt with problems in life, what I wanted to do with my life, etc. Photos, SAT scores, GPA, college information, family history information, etc. 

I had to be cleared by a psychologist to make sure I wasn't crazy, and also got my own lawyer (I paid for none of this).

The medical process was this:

After going on birth control for about a month, I stopped and for about a month I injected myself daily with hormones (right beneath the belly button). I took about two hours of public transportation to get to the clinic where I was being monitored, which was a slightly difficult near the end, as I am a full time student and I was going in almost every day, ha. Basically, they would take my blood to check how the hormones were doing, and give me an ultrasound to check on my eggs. The hormones make your ovaries become super fertile, so there are tens of eggs that become really large. The week before and after the surgery I was very bloated and it hurt to move much.

The surgery involved no cuts, just a needle up there. They did put me under. And I got to keep the purple surgery socks they gave me.

My spending habits have not changed, except for the fact that I put ten grand into a Roth IRA, donated about 1k to charity, and buy delicious expensive things like raspberries and chai tea slightly more often. 

No regrets so far.

AMA!

EDIT: **This concludes our Reddit AMA! Thanks for joining us, and for 10 AMAZING years. You guys rock.**"
743,IAmA,Request; Louis Theroux,"when you met Jimmy Saville, what was you opinion of him, and did it change over the weeks of filming? and if you had a feeling that he was the horrible human that he was, do you have any regrets about maybe not doing more to find out the real truth about him

out of all the people you have interview, who has changed your view of the world the most?

Did you form any lasting friendships with any of the people you met on the show?

and in the episode were you went to the brothel in vegas, did you have sex with the main girl in the episode? i personnally think you did because it seems like it would of been difficult not to!

EDIT: word changed form impossible to difficult"
745,IAmA,"IAmA Secretary of Manhattan Project civilian research director, Ernest Lawrence, who was central to the development of cyclotron and U-235 enrichment during WWII. AMAA","My grandmother worked in the ""Rad Lab"" in Berkeley, California during the second world war as one of Ernest Lawrence's secretaries.  I'm home for Thanksgiving with her, and thought I would see if anyone is interested in an AMA with her.
First, proof: http://imgur.com/LZWFh

She is 94, but her memory is still pretty good.  She personally knew Robert Oppenheimer, Glenn Seaborg, and General Leslie Groves.  She spoke on the phone with many other scientists, like Enrico Fermi.  While she did type up many reports for Lawrence, she does not have much technical knowledge of the project.  What she knows is more the experiences of being in the Rad Lab, like the security, personalities, and amusing stories.
After the war, my grandmother married my grandfather, who was an engineer in the Rad Lab.

**tl, dr:** My grandmother knows stuff about the people who made the first atomic bombs.

**EDIT:** I'm getting a fair number of down votes, which I suspect are from the people who are against nuclear weapons.  While that is certainly a valid opinion, I don't think this is the place to discuss it.

**EDIT 2:** This is fantastic, a lot of great questions.  Especially, about different people at the lab, the building, and what a day was like.  My grandmother was really interested in who are asking these questions.  So let us know!  Just like where you are and why you care.

**EDIT 3:** Alright, time for a time out.  My grandmother wants to help my mother with the cooking and such for dinner.  I think we can get back again later, and certainly tomorrow.  I'm hear all weekend and I will happily spend it with my grandmother answering every question we possibly can.  Please keep the questions coming!

**EDIT 4:** Wow, front page.  My grandmother and I will be on and off the next couple of days and we will answer as many questions as we have time for.  I'll try and read all of the questions to pick out the good ones, so please keep asking.  The things I would never have thought to ask are great!"

.A little about myself 


I have been competing for the last 4 years as a Natural Bodybuilder and coaching others around nutrition and training since 2011.

[This is what I look like today] (http://i.imgur.com/YcHpoMs.jpg)

[This is what I looked like last year] (http://i.imgur.com/TJYmj2Q.jpg)

[This is what i looked like 4 years ago] (http://i.imgur.com/ZMVSlGR.jpg)

[This was 6 months after I started working out] (http://i.imgur.com/DJ6JwlI.jpg)


**Stats**

Age: 24
Resides: Toronto, Canada
Contest Weight: 165lbs
Off-Season Weight: 180lbs
Height: 5’7 
Marital Status: Married

My outlook on health and fitness has changed dramatically since I first started in 2008, going from the TRADITIONAL HARDCORE or nothing mentality to more of a balanced and flexible approach to training and nutrition. Now I can actually live life lol. 

Here is some insight :

**3-5 years Ago** 

*Training: 3x a week, ONLY Chest and Arms, 5-10 sets of 10 reps.

*Nutrition: 2 meals a day, fruit in the morning and whatever I wanted for dinner.

*Philosophy: If I miss a meal or workout its ALL OVER, no going out with friends and supplements are drugs. 
 
*Progress Pics

http://i.imgur.com/ZMVSlGR.jpg

**1-2 years Ago**

*Training: Each body part 1x/week, Train to failure on all sets, train body parts equally, 20-30 sets 6-12 reps, Cardio 7 days a week 1 hour a day.

*Nutrition: 6 Meals a day, Only Chicken, White Fish, Sweet Potato, Brown Rice, Green Veggies. No counting macro nutrients just the type of food. 

*Philosophy: Go hard or go home. If I don't struggle then I havent worked. If I miss a meal or workout I am a failure but keep going until you are PERFECT. I need my supplements at all times, have to bring my food everywhere I go, so tired I could not function after 7pm, didnt care about nothing but bodybuilding.

http://i.imgur.com/TJYmj2Q.jpg


**Over the last 6 months** 

*Training : Daily Undulating Periodization Training model, switching between power, hypertrophy and strength workouts during the week, Monday/Wednesday/Friday upper body Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday Lower Body, Cardio 4x a week totally 2.5 hours (mix between HIIT and LISS)

*Nutrition : Flexible Dieting, counting and tracking macronutrients to determine intake, eating any food I want within the macronutrient profile I am following, making and eating healthy alternatives to the food I love , not being bound to eating at certain times and certain types of food, making sure solid amounts of fiber and micronutrient intake.
 
*Philosophy: Live a balanced life, striving for perfection leads you down the road of failure, you have to give yourself a buffer zone to sustain over the long term, don't let health and fitness dominate my life. Strive for excellence in multiple areas of life.

I want to share what I have learned through my experiences with the health and fitness community so hopefully people can live a more balanced life while still striving towards their health and fitness goals. 

That's why I started Live Young Dream Big. To challenge the ideology of Perfection and share through my own life The Less Than Perfect Approach to a balanced life.

Tossed all of that out the window, ran off to work as a bartender for Club Med, came home and became a drug dealer with annual sales revenue in excess of one million.  Was told on and approached by an undercover Narcotics team, which I wasn't aware of their identity and sped off hitting one who flew up on my windshield, held on for few seconds and shot me.  Spent 5 years in San Quentin Prison, worked as a Disciplinary Hearing Clerk, Ambulance Driver, Firefighter, and was one of the first inmate dog handlers, where my dog slept in my room.

752,IAmA,"I am deaf with bilateral cochlear implants, a hearing device shunned by the deaf community. AMA","I have severe to profound hearing loss in both ears due to my mother having Rubella while pregnant with me. I've had to wear hearing aids for my entire life until my late 20s when I had Tinnitus which required getting bilateral cochlear implants. Picture:

http://imgur.com/rX91U

Cochlear implants are looked down upon by many in the deaf community/culture as its seen as ""trying to become hearing"" and the thought that it would destroy ASL (which I'm proficient in.) The decision to get them myself was a very hard choice but I did it for my children, who are hearing, like the rest of my family.

Due to being able to wear hearing aids while growing up I got to experience both cultures as my entire family is hearing and I spent time in a program called Total Communication where we first learned SEE (Signing Exact English) and various speech therapy classes. We eventually switched to ASL and I also attended the Michigan School For The Deaf.

Ask Me Anything!

Edit: Currently getting flooded with replies so give me some time to get back to you but I will eventually. Thanks for all the awesome questions and responses so far. :D

Edit: Still here after the downtime.

Edit: Taking a 15 minute break. Be back at 7:30 AM EST. Keep the questions coming I am enjoying this and hope you are too! :)

Edit: Back! Still working my way through a ton of replies so if I haven't gotten to you yet I will.

Edit: 9:08 EST. Still answering questions but I have a 5 page backlog in my inbox. I will get around to answering all of them so don't be afraid to ask another in fear of not being answered. I will get to you!  

I wanted to say thanks for everyone discussing this in so much detail and I will eventually have time to read all of the discussion once I finish answering questions. I'm glad I could provide a topic like this for discussion and no matter what views you have on this topic it is very interesting hearing from everyone. Thank you very much!

Also if people would like more pictures of the external device or even a picture of the plate in my head (there is a noticeable bump) I will gladly post them if there is interest!

Okay, back to answering questions.

Edit: 10:30AM EST. Okay been answering questions for over eight hours now. Going to take a break for a few hours but I'll be back to answer all the questions I've missed. Feel free to continue asking questions and thanks again for everything! This was much more popular than I had expected.

Edit: 3:30 pm. Just woke up from a nap &amp; my step brother is still asleep. What fucking woke me up was sleep paralysis. I saw the 'thing' while sitting on top of me what feels like a 20 lbs of weight trying to suck life out of me, and a transparent white form of my step-brother also sitting on him, trying to cover his mouth &amp; nose. I was not able to move or speak as I wanted to yell ""Mark, help. Fucking. Sleep. Paralysis!"" As he was nearby. That didn't work. I also had auditory sounds from it for the first time. Scary shit. I then woke Mark up and told him what happened.
Anyways- I'm back to reading new replies &amp; answering any questions I've missed. Keep the questions coming! My step brother and I throughly ejoyed it! :)

762,IAmA,IAMA architect who's main interest is high efficiency affordable homes - AMA.,"**WHY:**

This was started after I replied to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hxngl/what_is_the_biggest_way_people_waste_money/caz11mm) and [a few people asked for an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hxngl/what_is_the_biggest_way_people_waste_money/caz7v4h).

**WHAT I DO:**

Currently I work for an architecture firm in Chicago. Previously I worked for an [architectural engineer](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2012/02/picturequote.html) who designed the mechanical systems for some of the most energy efficient buildings in Chicago. ([1](http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/theskyline/2009/07/going-net-zerofor-effect-1stofitskind-home-in-chicago-will-produce-as-much-energy-as-it-uses.html), [2](http://www.dbhms.com/portfolio/green/green-03.html), [3](http://inhabitat.com/harmony-house-cat-shelter-is-chicagos-first-net-zero-commercial-building/)). I have a [M.Arch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Architecture) degree from IIT. Prior to that I apprenticed as a mechanical engineer/contractor (I built really big complex industrial stuff [1](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2012/10/picturequote.html), [2](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2011/05/returning-hate-for-hate-multiplies-hate.html), [3](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2009/12/picturequote.html)).

My main interest is affordable energy efficient homes. There are many ways to make a building energy efficient, but making it comfortable, inexpensive, and attractive at the same time is the challenge. There are many people who say they can do this, but there are few actual construction companies and architects who are truly interested in this. Telling someone their home will cost 5%-15% more than a home of a similar size is not a great selling point. Also, banks rarely see the value in it, although things are slowly changing.

The main software I use for energy modeling is PHPP (passive house planning package). It's a very intense excel spreadsheet that requires a good knowledge of physics and a decent amount of coffee to operate. For drawings I use [Revit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Revit) which is essentially CAD 2.0.

Also, I can give advice on energy retrofits, but please be specific about where you live, what you're trying to achieve, etc.

**PROOF:**

[This is all the posts tagged architecture from my blog](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/search/label/architecture). If you scroll down there's a picture of my degree.

[Here's a post announcing this AMA](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2013/07/reddit-ama.html).

**DISCLOSURE:**

Legally I cannot call myself an architect as I am not yet licensed. Technically I'm an intern architect according to AIA definitions. To become licensed in the US you need:

* A professional or masters degree depending on the state
* 5,600 hours of internship under a licensed architect (you can do about 1/3 under a licensed engineer too)
* Pass 7 tests of which the pass rate is 60%-80% per test. If you fail one you can't take it again for 6 months. You have 5 years to complete them or it all resets. Each tests costs $210 to take.

That being said in the state of IL I can still legally design single family homes of a certain size [without a license](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1340&amp;ChapterID=24), and unlike most architects I actually build things ([1](http://alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2011/09/walnut-entry-table.html), [2](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/search/label/woodshop), [3](http://alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2012/11/jatoba-and-aluminum-coffee-table.html), [4](http://logantreed.tumblr.com/post/50416909244)).

James, the owner/operator of the site, put together a quick montage last night on our [Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/eatmoreheat) to show you some highlights of my last few years.

So I've ridden bulls, drank flaming absynthe with a voodoo high priestess in a haunted bar in New Orleans, puked my guts up on national TV, I've done drops of 6 million SHU solution, I've had John Konesky of Tenacious D write me into a song, and all in all, I'd say I've lived an interesting life in my 25 years.  I'll be here for at least two hours, so Ask Me Anything!

**May the fourth (edit) be with you:**  Alright reddit, it's been a blast.  Incredibly.  You don't know how thrilled I am to have spread the joy and burn of hot sauce to so many of you, or the ecstasy in knowing just how much you all appreciate hot sauce, and my answering.

767,IAmA,"IAmA a guy who fractured my penis last year, had a series of 12 injections in my penis to fix it that didn't work, and then had penile surgery last week to finally repair the damage. AMA!","Proof: [NSFW] http://imgur.com/a/wM32q (Mods approved before I blacked out anything)
Edit: To clarify, the dick pics are all post-surgery taken today, with the exception of the one with the surgeon working, that was on May 1, 2013.

In May of last year I was having sex with my girlfriend and fractured my penis. This fracture resulted in what is called Peyronie's Disease, which is basically a plaque buildup that causes a bend in the penis. 

The first attempt at addressing my peyronie's was a series of 12 injections of Verapamil which is designed to break up the plaque and eliminate most of the bending. This didn't work. So, last week on May 1, 2013 I had penile surgery to remove the plaque and replace it with tissue from a cadaver heart.

tl;dr: I fractured my penis, had 12 injections in the penis that didn't fix it, and finally had surgery on it last week.

Ask me anything!

Update: I know it's cliche, but holy cow front page! I just arrived home so I should be able to keep answering questions. Keep 'em coming.

Update 2: Thanks again for all of the questions and comments. You all have been such a positive influence on my day and a welcome distraction of the pain I'm currently going through. I am done answering questions for the night, but I'll see if I can't get to a few more of you all tomorrow. Thanks again!

Update 3: I am back this morning answering questions and since I have nothing to do but wallow in the pain of my recently surgically repaired penis, I should be here most of the day. Thanks again to everyone who has shown interest and offered well wishes, it has really meant a lot to me and it is helping to keep me focused on something positive.

Final Update: Looks like most of the questions have been answered. I went through and read every single comment and I really do appreciate all of you who stopped by. I will probably do an update post in a few months since there seem to be quite a few questions regarding the recovery that I am just not far along enough to answer yet. Thanks reddit!"

771,IAmA,IAmA 24yo electrical engineer with magnets implanted in my fingertips. AMA.,"I was recently commenting on a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/tjlc9/man_drills_magnets_into_arm_to_mount_ipod/) in /r/WTF, and made mention of my neodymium magnetic implants. [The comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/tjlc9/man_drills_magnets_into_arm_to_mount_ipod/c4n6dw5) garnered a substantial amount of attention, and I had a bunch of people telling me to do an AMA on the subject. Well, OP delivers. 

Me and two of my friends (who may share their experiences in a bit) had parylene coated neodymium magnets [implanted into our fingertips](http://i.imgur.com/Vrg0s.jpg) in October of last year. We are in no way the first to do this, but you all seem interested in knowing more about the procedure, and more specifically, why the hell we would want to do something like this. 

My implants have allowed me the ability to ""see"" magnetic fields. Any device that has alternating current flowing through an inductive load throws off substantial amounts of magnetic energy. I can feel the shape, intensity, and frequency of this field as the magnets in my fingers shake in response. 

They have changed my life, and I think they are freaking awesome. 
So please; AMA.


Why did I have it done: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tl7pn/iama_24yo_electrical_engineer_with_magnets/c4nls5w) is about the best reason.



**EDIT: Sorry all, I'm going to have to call it quits for the night. My ass is falling asleep and my hands are on fire. I hope I answered enough questions. Thanks for all the interest! I might post up some more pictures tonight if I can finish enough of my grad project to take a break.** 


**UPDATE**

Alright, I'm going to try to sum up some FREQUENTLY asked questions.


* **Why?**

*Because science.*

* **What if you need an MRI?**

*I am concerned about this. I don't want people to think that I'm blowing it off. I do understand the awe inspiring magnetic field that a magnetic resonance imager produces. I do understand that there is a possibility that it could cause harm. From what I understand, and from some VERY rough calculations, the likelihood that it would actually RIP my implants from my fingertips are slim. I am far more concerned that it would demagnetize my implants. Also, I do intend on making sure that any technician that would me giving me an MRI knows about the implants, because I guarantee that he is going to understand what could happen far better than I would.* 

*Now, there ARE people that have these implants that have had to have an MRI and have reported that, although it was uncomfortable, it did not cause any damage. The implants are small enough that it shouldn't be much of an issue at all.*

* **How about other strong magnets?**

*Well, I've played with some seriously strong magnets and it wasn't an issue. I did get near a 300lb lift magnet and that was a little uncomfortable, but it wasn't bad. My concern is that if a magnet stays on the skin for too long, it will cut off the blood flow and the implant will reject. So I generally don't get too close to a super strong magnet. I've been near some HUGE magnetic fields like monstrous permanent magnet motors and big welders, and that was just fun. It feels crazy.*

* **Won't you break _______?**

*Probably not. My implants only have a weak magnetic field (~600uT), which is not enough to harm anything. I can't break a hard drive. I can't erase debit cards. I don't hurt my laptop. LCD screens aren't really affected by magnets. As far as things I might be working with in my profession: really the only thing in the ECE world that would be affected by magnetic fields this small is in MEMS design. This is because the systems you are designing are so small and fragile... I hate MEMS. I work in power electronics and the components that I work with can take a hell of a beating.*

* **How painful was it?**

*Quite. There was a rather sizable incision made into my fingertip, and the magnet was forcibly inserted into a layer of fat below my skin. It didn't feel good. The first week of healing sucked. After that, things were smooth sailing.*

* **Won't they reject?**
 
*There is always the possibility. My implants are coated in Parylene, which is biologically neutral and rust proof. It's the same stuff that they coat pacemakers with. I really hope it doesn't happen, but there is a possibility of rejection with any body modification.*

* **Can I do this without the implant?**

*Absolutely! You won't have the same level of sensitivity that I do, but I've heard of people glazing small neodymium magnets to their fingernails. That would be a good ""test drive"" before you consider an implant.*

* **What does it feel like?**

*Well, they are small. The implants are thin discs ~2mm*0.5mm. I have them in my ring finger and thumb on my left hand. The sensation I get near a magnetic field changes from field to field. AC fields cause the magnets to shake in my fingertips. This causes a similar sensation to bumping your elbow and your fingers going numb. Though, this changes in fields of different frequency or intensity. DC and permanent magnet fields just feel like it's tugging on my finger.*


* **What about playing the guitar?**

*I'm not boss enough to be able to play any instrument. Sorry, I can't answer this one*


* **Are they removable?**

*Yeah... It'd just take a scalpel and some ice. I'd rather not have it come to that though*

* **Do you regret getting them?**

*Not even the slightest bit.*



Alright, I REALLY need to get off of here and work on my grad project. I need to finish a board layout. Thanks for the questions!


**UPDATE 2**
Holy crap, I did not expect this to receive nearly this much attention. I just got [a mention in PopSci](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-05/electrical-engineer-can-feel-magnetic-fields-through-magnets-implanted-his-fingertips)! I really appreciate it. I didn't think people would find this quite so fascinating. 

I'm sorry, but I'm probably not going to be able to answer many more questions. This AMA blew up more than I ever thought it would, and I'm all sorts of behind schedule on my projects now. 

I want to give one last shout out to my local hackerspace, [LVL1](http://www.lvl1.org/). This awesome crew of people are who gave me the last push to have the procedure done. I highly suggest that if you think stuff like this is cool, you go and pay your local hackerspace a visit. Getting involved in such a community is probably one of the best things I've ever done."

I broke my neck in August 2011 (C 5/6) when I jumped on a bank of sand in the Danube. The result is a traumatic spinal core injury, which lead to a complete paralysis of most parts of my body. This means now I am only able to move/feel my head, my shoulders and parts of my arms/hands. Most likely for the rest of my life.

784,IAmA,"On my very first sexual encounter, I broke my penis (penile fracture), I now literally have a button located near my shaft that allows me to get an erection. My new girlfriend calls it the iPenis, anyway AMA, I've heard it all from my friends!","So when I was 17 years old (now 26) my brother had a party at our house. He wis 2.5 years my elder. After the party closed up a few people stayed over.

One such was cute but chubby girl, lets call ""Alicia"" I say lets call her Alicia, because that is her name is real life. It's Alicia. Anyway, she knocks on my door and asks if she can sleep next to me for all the other beds were taken and the couch was as well, I told her sure thing!

Anyway, about an hour later out of a drunken sleep she rolls over and stops me of my underwear and stars riding me. I get very, very excited as you can imagine for this is my first time. I somewhat sit up so I can thrust as she rides. Anyway, I get way to into and really start thrusting as does she. Are rhythm failed and she violently thrusted one way and I the other. POP! The loudest noise popped from inside her and extreme pain filled my entire groin region. I literally passed out for 2-3 mins. By then my brother and his girlfriend were around me and they the girls were assessing the damage. I was already starting to bruise and demanded to be taken to the hospital. Anyway, the prognoses was not good. I had severely fractured (still called fracturing even no bones are involved) my penis. In his words (the worst I've ever seen.)

I ha d an operation to fix the tears and whatnot, but still was unable to get an erection. After 6 months with zero erections I became depressed. So I decided to get a surgery to help me achieve an erection.

What I had installed (lol) was an inflatable penile prosthesis. Once things are starting to look like I may get lucky, I press a button located underneath and to the side of my shaft, that actually allows a big to inflate and make me hard. The erection isn't as powerful as my old natural erections, but it does allow for me to achieve orgasm. Anyway, This story also doubles for my most embarrassing so, shoot me any questions or stories of your own!

Summary (Broke penis on first encounter, now have an inflatable penis, girlfriend loves new robotic penis and calls it the iPenis.)

Edit: Guys: I'm not ignoring your proof requests, my entire office is now on to this post and they are actually chanting 'proof, proof, proof' as well. I can't very will flop it out and take a picture of the suture scars, but in good time I promise to provide adequate proof or you can down vote me to oblivion. I'm running home for lunch, I'll gather proof for you guys. Thanks for the hilarious questions.

Edit 2: (NSFW) Also Mom/co workers do not click -  I had my girlfriend text me a picture I sent her a few months back. We have a ongoing joke regarding the pump. Anyway, this is as erect as I can get. What you can't see is the inflatable device, which runs atop the penis shaft. This would be around 10-20 pumps on the inflatable prosthesis.

787,IAmA,IAMA Request: Jon Stewart,"Jon does an incredible job calling out the media (*fox news*) on their daily bullshit, and I love it.  It would be kick ass to get some form of reddit interview with him (IAMA or Official).

Edit2: If we get this high enough, someone who works at the daily show might see this.  I'm sure there are some redditors that work there.  Next idea:  IAMA Daily Show Writer?

Edit3: While I listed fox news specifically, it is in fact the whole of national news networks whose bullshit Mr. Stewart calls out.  I chose fox news, because they seem to make it oh so easy."
788,IAmA,I make over $100k per month running Drop-Ship product websites (proof inside).. AMAA,"I run a few niche product websites that drop-ship from wholesalers. I started doing this about 4 years ago in 2008 and I now make over $100k every month from my websites.

I will not publicly disclose what my domain names are because I do not want to get spammed, but I will message the Admins as extra proof.

Feel free to ask me anything about drop-shipping, web development, SEO, or just running a business in general..

EDIT:  I have been trying my best to answer every single question. In the past hour this has really gained speed quickly and I am seeing the same questions over and over. So if you're question is not replied to directly, then you can be sure that others have asked the same thing and I answered it already at least once.

Also.. Many people have been asking me to write a step-by-step Guide on how to start a successful drop-ship site. I would be happy to do this, but I don't want to half-ass it. So please give me a few hours and I will have something written up by late tonight along with examples. (only $29.99 via Paypal)  KIDDING!!! haha

I'm happy to see such a huge positive response to this. I am absolutely flooded with PM's but don't worry I plan to reply to every one of them. It may take me a week to respond to them all though, so please be patient if you wrote me a message. I'm not ignoring you, I promise. Thanks!

Due to the INSANE amount of demand for me to write a Step-By-Step Guide, I guess OP must deliver.. I'll work on this starting right now and LINK to the Guide tonight at 11pm EST. It will include the whole process from brainstorming product ideas, to developing the websites, to dealing with suppliers and customers. I will include recommended software, analytics, and marketing tools that I use myself. My whole day is shot ;)

790,IAmA,IAmA guy who had debris from an airplane engine smash through his car. Air Canada has refused to do anything about it!,"Almost a year ago, I was visiting an account (gas station) near Pearson Airport in Toronto. While going about my business inside, a lady from outside started to ask who's car was parked out back. After realizing it was mine, I went outside to see what had happened. Here it is (along with articles):

http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/05/29/falling_debris_in_mississauga_was_from_plane_that_took_off_from_pearson.html

http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/28/debris-from-air-canada-jet-believed-to-have-struck-cars-after-engine-fails-over-toronto/

Not wanting to be a douche about it, I decided to not take any aggressive action against the party responsible (Air Canada), in hopes that they would engage in common courtesy regarding the matter. Boy was I wrong. First off, they acknowledged that this was indeed their airplane and their fault. My name and information was everywhere at the time and reporters were having no issues getting my phone number to ask questions. Secondly, after a couple weeks had passed, not a single representative had contacted me about the ordeal. No ""how are you doing?"" Nothing.

Insurance covered most of the cost of fixing my car, but I still had to pay the deductible which cost quite a bit. I reached out to let Air Canada know, and they simply told me to talk to my insurance provider and employer to solve the issue. Basically brushing me off (This was the one and only time they ever communicated with me btw). Fine. I'm friends with a lawyer at my gym and he offered to write a letter to them in hopes of escalating the situation. Air Canada did not respond. I've waited. And waited. And waited. Here we are.

In one month, a full year will have passed. Initially I was fine with them just covering the damages. Mistakes happen. Albeit, this is quite a big mistake. A piece of airplane engine did explode and smash through my car after all. Had I not been inside and in my car instead, who knows what could have happened (well, I'm pretty sure I know what would have happened). The disrespect, dismissive nature and lack of compassion shown just annoys me off. What do I do??

Hello reddit people,

My name is Roald Riepen and I am the managing director of www.FreeOnes.com (nsfw /18+)

For those not familiar with FreeOnes, we run one of the biggest (adult) model databases online since 1998.  We currently have about 2 million daily visitors on the site (desktop and mobile) and we list over 27k models. 

Last March was our 15 year anniversary and because of that we thought it would be fun to do a reddit AMA. Besides that our ""We now accept bitcoin"" thread here was fun to do so lets go! I will do my best to reply as fast as possible and will get help of Petra, one of our all-round managers. She will start her replies with ""Reply Petra:"" to keep all clear on whos who!

**EDIT 1**: Our 15 years Infograph:  http://hostones.com/temp/Roald/infograph.jpg 

**EDIT 2**: wew that went well so far, I am suprised about some questions and on the other hand was prepared for questions you guys did not ask yet. Keep it coming, really enjoying it so far.

**Proof this is actually FreeOnes**: https://twitter.com/freeones/ Tweet saying: Since I am doing an AMA on reddit and they need proof that it is me, here you Reddit :) Hope this works.

796,IAmA,"Hey Reddit, this is EFF's activism team! We are starting a week long campaign against CISPA today - AMA","Hey Reddit, this is the activism team for Electronic Frontier Foundation ([Rainey Reitman](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/rainey-reitman), [Trevor Timm](https://twitter.com/#!/wllegal), and [Parker Higgins](https://twitter.com/#!/xor), along with legal intake coordinator [Mark Jaycox](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/mark-m-jaycox) and international outreach coordinator [Maira Sutton](https://twitter.com/#!/mairasutton)). We just launched a week of action against CISPA, a dangerous ‘cybersecurity’ bill that blows a hole in virtually all existing privacy laws. 

Thankfully, Reddit has already been spreading the word about CISPA, but if anyone needs a refresher, here is [our just-published FAQ](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/cybersecurity-bill-faq-disturbing-privacy-dangers-cispa-and-how-you-stop-it) on all the bill’s dangerous provisions that threaten Internet freedom.

Please visit our [Stop Cyber Spying](https://cyberspying.eff.org/) page to easily tweet at your member of Congress using the hashtag #CongressTMI. You can then go to [our action center](https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8444) to email your member of Congress. 

But this is an AMA, of course, and we are no Woody Harrelson. So please feel free to ask us anything. We can talk SOPA, ACTA, TPP, our proposed exemptions for jailbreaking tablets and video game consoles, the RIAA’s ‘six strikes’ program, or anything else that crosses your mind.

Obligatory legal disclaimer: We can't offer legal advice, so please don’t give us the specifics about any legal problems in your public posting. Sorry! But if you do have a specific legal issue, [here’s a link](https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance) to our page about getting legal help from EFF. There also may be cases we are involved in we may not be able to comment on. 

Our first [AMA is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ot98v/hey_reddit_were_the_activism_team_at_eff_thanks/). And you can [go here to support EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate). 

And [here's proof we're real](https://twitter.com/#!/EFF/status/191954709333028864).

**EDIT**: Thanks for all the questions folks. We can keep going for another 60-90 minutes, even though we've just been scooped on IAMA by Ridiculously Photogenic Guy. What are the chances? But as [Parker](https://twitter.com/#!/xor) notes, ""No hard feelings from us: we may spend our days defending the Internet, but he's what makes the Internet worth defending.""

**EDIT 2**: Okay, I'm afraid we have to call it a day. Thanks again to everyone, we hope to come back soon. If you have any additional questions about protecting Internet freedom, Ridiculously Photogenic Guy's AMA is still going on and we are confident he can handle them.

Oh, and one more thing: Are you in college and interested in starting a group based around EFF issues at your school? We may soon have travel funding to visit your school to give a talk and help organize. Email rainey@eff.org with the subject line 'college outreach' for more info."

AMA","I've spent over two years of my life living outside, camping. I've spent one summer living indoors since I was 12 or thirteen. I've lived under tarps, in caves, and tents. I've slept in cabins, adirondacks, and nothing. I've slept in hammocks and cowboy-roll bags. 

When I was 18, I spent three months living off off less than $200. I've gone months without showers or running water. I've hidden from park rangers, and etc. I've taught wilderness survival and other outdoorsy skills. I've woken up with ticks crawling on my face, and I've spent nights shivering and doing pushups to stay alive. 

I've literally walked into a bear once. I've touched things that no one ever has before. 

I've hallucinated from lack of water, and gone days without eating.

Canadians ripped off my wine money once. Bastards.

I was taught how to drink whiskey by other outdoorsmen with beards.

800,IAmA,IAMA Electrician at the deepest nickel mine in Canada. AMA,"I work at Creighton Mine in Sudbury, Ontario. I have done an AMA about 8 months ago, but there has been interest for me to do another. So AMA!

jftduncan pointed out a couple cool facts about Creighton in another thread,m thought I'd share them here:

&gt;Some other things that are fairly unique about kyriose's mine:
*has continuously operated since roughly 1910s.
*it is seismically active, it experiences seismic events of about 2.0 on a fairly regular basis.
*It is a thermal mine. The ambient temperature can be &gt;30C in some parts of the mine or hotter if there is equipment operating in the area.
*To deal with the heat, it has a natural heat exchange system where fresh air for the mine is drawn through old workings. This has the effect of heating the air during the winter months and cooling the air in the summer.
*is host to an underground scientific laboratory. Due to it's depth at 6800' below surface, it is the cleanest lab with respect to cosmic radiation. allowing them to do experiments studying nutrinos and the search for dark matter.

**Edit 1: I am trying to answer everyones questions, I didn't think that this would be so big! I have to leave for work now but I will try to answer as many as I can when I can.**

**Edit 2: Sorry guys I got lined up with a lot of work tonight, I will be going down to an older part of the mine so I'll take a ton of pictures.**

**Edit 3: jeezus84 did a coop in the SNO lab, and since everyone seems to be interested in that [here](http://imgur.com/a/FtGTShttp://imgur.com/a/FtGTS) are some pictures he linked me.**

**Edit 4: I went down 3-shaft tonight which is the shallowest of the shafts here at Creighton. I took some pictures so you could get a decent idea of what it looks like down there, as well as a couple videos. Not sure if you can share video on imgur but I will try as I don't have access to YouTube at work. The furthest I went down today is 1900, but I got to go to some creepy old areas and get the best pictures I could in near complete darkness. My work computer's internet access kind of REALLY sucks so I'll have to upload them when I get home tonight.**"
801,IAmA,"IAMA person with a severe form of ichthyosis, often talked about on r/WTF. Pictures of my skin inside. AMA.","Hi Reddit!

We are Candlesandfish and Confettiskin on a joint account created for this AMA. Two of us have a severe form of ichthyosis; Candlesandfish has written about living with ichthyosis on /r/wtf before, and the two of us on Confettiskin have also participated.

**UPDATE 3:45 ET** Our blog at confettiskin.com was down but is back now. Please check out our blog and links here. We'll try to backfill responses as time permits. If you get errors please refresh DNS, etc.

Kyriaki is Australian, Jennifer and Rachel live in the USA. We'll all be posting under this screenname, to make the AMA easier, with initials so you know who is who. It's night-time in Australia right now so she'll stay on until she has to go to sleep, and then Jennifer and Rachel will stay during the day.

Candlesandfish: I'm Kyriaki, and I have lamellar ichthyosis. I did a mini-AMA about Ichthyosis three months ago which you can find [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/15lzys/lamellar_ichthyosis/c7nqiko). Proof that it's really me is here: http://imgur.com/n0mL8PP (and yes, there's a typo in the screenname at the bottom, my bad!), which you can compare with the photos posted here (and in that mini-AMA).

The scales shed constantly and there's a much higher skin turnover rate than a normal person, but it takes a different form where they're very thick, and only small parts come off at a time, usually pieces ranging in size between my pinkie and thumbnails. It's messy and weird and actually very painful if it's not kept incredibly well moisturised and then oils used to hold the moisture in. The stuff I used for the first 21 years of my life was about 90% paraffin and literally melted on my skin if the weather was too hot. If you don't keep it hydrated, the scales tighten together and the under layer below the skin is exposed in between the scales, and the gaps show as red skin with no protection, and it hurts like hell. 

Other aspects of the condition are issues with temperature regulation (I can't sweat) and light sensitivity, as well as digestive issues.

I use heavy moisturisers and I've been on roaccutane for about a year, which has worked miracles on my skin which now looks much more normal, albeit dry. I'll probably stay on it the rest of my life now, except for when I want to have children.

Here's me with the absolute best my skin could ever look without roaccutane, taken last January, it took me several hours to get my skin to look this good - the discolouration patterning on my arms and chest is most noticeable, since I did a lot of work to make my face look normal.
http://i.imgur.com/F2xL0.jpg 

This is more like normal: http://i.imgur.com/HVUtX.jpg 

This is in between, about a month into roaccutane, taken because I'd managed to dye myself pink with a bath bomb and it amused me - ichthyosis scales are very good at taking up colour because it's dead skin, and pink scales were funny.

Foot: http://i.imgur.com/FFgGZ.jpg 

Stomach (taken by me, so a bit weird) from a side angle - the pink is at the edges of the scales): http://i.imgur.com/R2Yho.jpg 

And this is me now - the snake must have liked me because we're related, scaly skin and all ;) You can see the remnants of the scales on my upper chest on one side of the v-neck. http://i.imgur.com/vKylH.jpg 

Finally, here's a link to a scientific (but readable) explanation of the reason that our skin does what it does - it's to do with genes being mutated, and I'm finding it really interesting having not come across it before. Lamellar is one subtype of the type they discuss in the paper, and the type discussed is rare. http://www.firstskinfoundation.org/content.cfm/Ichthyosis/Autosomal-Recessive-Congenital-Ichthyosis-ARCI-2008/page_id/700

Confettiskin:  We are Rachel and Jennifer. Rachel and our three boys are all affected with a very rare form of ichthyosis called ichthyosis-en-confetti, and since last year we have been blogging on [confettiskin.com](http://confettiskin.com). Our [full bio](http://confettiskin.com/wp/2012/09/02/welcome-to-our-blog/) has more details. Rachel has posted about how she sometimes has [mobility problems caused by her ichthyosis](http://confettiskin.com/wp/2012/11/12/lack-of-mobility/) (which has a picture of her foot). And yesterday she took some [additional pictures](http://imgur.com/a/LEwDc) for Reddit. We have also written extensively about [harlequin ichthyosis](http://confettiskin.com/wp/category/types/arci/harlequin/)

Edit:

Lot's of recurring questions:

How much did it cost?  - I spent 10.000USD. Could easily have done it on 4.000USD. I just went nuts a bit.
Where did you go? - Main travel plan: NYC - Chicago - St. Louis - Kansas City - Denver - Roadtrip to Wyoming, south dakota, montana, Yellowstone national park, grand tetans, Idaho, Utah, All National parks in southern utah, Arizona, Grand Canyon, Colorado - Denver - Kansas city - St Louis - Nashville - Atlanta - Orlando - Washington DC - NYC. Of course also did everything in between and many side excursions with locals.


Edit 2: I love the response, never thought this would be of interest to anyone.
If I missed your question or follow up question, please be patient or message me privately. I'm up to talking to anyone about anything.

Edit 3: Lots of interest in more pictures. I'll make public albums. Please be patient!

Edit 4: Soooooo many questions! Unfortunately I have to go right now (you know, time difference and all ;)). I will return to answer more in about 12 hours from now. Also, all the people I asked to contact me, please do! All the people that want to contact me privately, please also do!

Edit 7: I will keep answering questions, but please be patient. 7500 comments to go through is a lot! And my inbox is filled with PM's too. I will respond to everyone though.

Edit 8: For all people saying I forgot California. It was a choice not to go there this time. Only had so much time. I feel the west coast deserves its own multi month trip. Going to West coast is my childhood dream so it will happen.

807,IAmA,"I am the ""Gangster Squad"" journalist and author who wrote the articles and book the movie is based on…","Thanks, everyone. My fingers are tingling and my brain numb from trying to answer all the provocative questions. Plus, the dog's barking for a walk. So off I go. Let's do it again sometime. PL

 Hi, Reddit community. I spent more than a decade chronicling the real Los Angeles Police “Gangster Squad” that inspired the current film…and considerable debate on Reddit yesterday. So if you want to know what was true, and what was Hollywood dramatization, shoot me questions (not bullets). By way of background:   

When the cast of Warner Bros. film version of “Gangster Squad” was preparing to stage the movie’s final confrontation – a wild Tommy Gun shoot-‘em-up between the crew of LAPD cops and the henchmen of the hoodlum Mickey Cohen – Ryan Gosling asked me, “Did any of these guys get killed?” By these guys he meant the real-life members of the real Gangster Squad, which was formed by the Los Angeles Police Department back in 1946 to battle the real Mickey Cohen and other mob figures following a series of shootings that threatened L.A.’s image as America’s sun-washed Garden of Eden. I told Gosling that of the eight original members of the squad, two had been shot and wounded on the job, but before they joined the unit. And the only one killed after the squad was formed, the giant Texan “Jumbo” Kennard, died not in a hail of bullets but when his car struck a bus on a rain-soaked Wilshire Boulevard after a night of drinking. In the film version of  “Gangster Squad,” in contrast, one of the squad had already been knocked off by Mickey’s men and another was about to get it in the shootout being staged as Gosling and Josh Brolin stormed an historic L.A. hotel where the film’s Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) was holed up. 

The embellishment should surprise no one familiar with the ways of Hollywood, or the conventions of films on small, elite crews of crime-fighters such as “The Magnificent Seven” or “The Untouchables” – a couple of the good guys are going to bite the dust before the rest prevail over the forces of evil. In this case, Warner Bros. made no secret of the cinematic liberties being taken. As a number of Reddit commentators noted yesterday, the film did not even describe itself as “based on” a true story, it opted for the lesser “inspired by.” On location that night, as Gosling and Brolin grabbed their machine guns to have it out with Sean Penn, the main producer, Dan Lin, termed the unfolding action as, most basically, “Boys with toys.”  In real life, the men of the LAPD’s Gangster Squad indeed carried Thompson submachine guns to intimidate hoods like Mickey but never once fired them. The only time a squad member tried to pull the trigger, when confronting a brother of the notorious Al Capone, the Tommy failed to fire. 

I bring this up because of the extensive discussion on Reddit yesterday inspired by a wonderfully provocative post by the granddaughter of Sgt. Jack O’Mara, the squad leader played by Brolin, declaring, “The movie butchered my grandfather’s life.”  Well, I first met the real Sgt. O’Mara in 1992 and spent many afternoons in his living room, and soon after met the roguish Sgt. Jerry Wooters (the character now played by Gosling), all while researching what first became a series of articles in the Los Angeles Times, “L.A. Noir: Tales from the Gangster Squad,” then recently was expanded into the nonfiction book, “Gangster Squad,” which indeed is quite different from the film. So, as I said, shoot…with questions.

812,IAmA,"IAMA former Rosetta Stone employee who speaks 8 languages, AMAA.","I worked for RS for years, and have used their programs in versions 2, 3, and 4 for 7 foreign languages. I know which of their programs work, which don't, and *why*. 

**I have invited a few other former employees to join me here, and will update with their usernames so you can keep an eye out for their responses**

**The obvious questions:**

*  does it work? - Yes and no, it *really* depends on the language in question. Some languages (French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German, Chinese, English...) it works very well, others (Arabic, Turkish, Japanese) it is a very flawed endeavor, but *may* still be a useful tool, depending on the person.


* Did you really learn 7 foreign languages with RS? - Yes and no; for some it was my primary method of acquisition, for others it was a great tool, and for others it was apparently an impediment to my success. I'm certified in 2 of the 7. I have former colleagues who I'm friend with who speak 5-10 languages each, and there are others who spent years with RS and just didn't bother to learn anything. 


* Adults don't learn like children, WTF is with their advertising? - It's advertising. Some people subscribe to the ""critical period"" hypothesis and would argue kids learn better than adults could ever hope to, others will point out that 5 year olds are complete fucking idiots and that any adult who spoke at the level of a 5 year old after 5 years of study should be ridiculed for their incompetence in language learning. Both are kind of irrelevant, in that RS is just trying to get people to buy a program that's built around a different framework, using popular ideas about linguistics.

813,IAmA,IAmA pedestrian who was hit by a bicyclist.,"I can't be too specific as the case is still going on, but last year as I was walking to class, I was hit from behind by a bicyclist going at least 20mph.  The impact and fall fucked up my knee, broke my laptop that was in my backpack, and sprained my ankle.  I didn't hear the bicyclist coming because his bike was so silent.  This was in broad daylight on a crowded campus with a slight downhill slope.  My guess is that he moved to dodge someone who turned, and hit me.

As tried to get back up, realizing the horrible pain I was in, the bicyclist told me to watch where the fuck I was going and started to try to ride off.  I tried to get him to stop but he didn't.  I called the police.  He was picked up minutes later, but released, because since he wasn't driving a motor vehicle it couldn't be prosecuted under hit and run.  Instead, it is being prosecued under assault and battery.

I am suing him for the cost of medical bills (about 8k so far), the cost of replacing my laptop ($1k), and for two weeks of my salary since I wasn't able to work ($400).

They rallied their biker friends to play the 'entitled car driver' card and leave trash on my car and send me harassing Facebook messages.  One time I had to get campus security to come out and physically remove them from my car, since they decided they were going to sit behind my car and play cards, since I had no other way out.  I am in the process of getting a restraining order against him as well.

EDIT:
Getting a lot of downvotes here.  I'm sorry that some people can't drive, but don't downboat/blame me for being the messenger.

EDIT2:
Apparently the guy is part of some kind of biker club and one or more of them is a Reddit reader.  I found thier (public) Facebook page and there are about 50 of them conspiring to fuck with me on here.  One of them also ran into me at school a while ago and said I better knock it off or that they'll make life very difficult for me.  I'd post the group, but my lawyer advised against.  Fuck this crowd mentality and fuck bikers.

EDIT3:
I've since learned that this cyclist culture really blew up in Poland.  The critical masses, the douchebaggery, the self-entitlement..it was pretty much imported from there.  Cities have been locked up completely for hours because cyclists wanted more 'rights' (as in, precedence over pedestrians on the sidewalk/road/etc).  Then it spread to our west coast, then our east coast, then everywhere else it goes on.  You know how cities can make people with overgrown yards mow their grass, to get rid of the vermin that might take up residence there?  Poland is the home owner, and these douche cyclists are the high grass.  The only real solution is to invade and teach them some order.  That's our burden.

EDIT4:
Okay, enough with the Poland joke.  The other lawyer actually pulled the 'anti-Semite' card today because apparently the defendant is Jewish.  It stems from the fact that I said that he and his group can go fuck themselves the other day before I called the police to remove them from behind my car.  Seriously?  I didn't even know he was Jewish.  It wouldn't matter.  Of course, now I've been receiving calls/emails from his family and friends of his family for being anti-Jew.  I've gotten about ten phone calls and a few emails today talking about how my future career is over and how I'm going to be expelled etc etc.  Lawyer says to keep my cool and not talk to any of them because anything I say will only make them madder and give them more ammo to make me look anti-Semitic."

A year ago when a video I directed, [*Sexy Saxman*](http://youtu.be/mKSyPoxzT6w), was upvoted to the number-one spot on Reddit for a day, I was exhilarated! I had never thought millions of people would be into something I created. The next morning I figured it'd be business as usual, but thanks to all the love and attention my YouTube channel got, so many doors opened up for me. I was finally able to focus on my passion, which is directing music videos for my favorite artists, creating shorts, my own music, and eventually make a living off [my YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/mikediva).

&gt; Diva's vision is a dystopian, zombie-filled future Los Angeles where gore and neon splatter the screen and a band of warriors embark on a video game-esque quest to kill the big bad guy – each of their blows in sync with the bass line.

I know a lot of people have questions about arrhytmias, this is a subject best approached with a cardiologist but i will answer your questions if you have some. I would like if people ask questions related more to surgery and VADs.

Edit: whao some many tough questions, well i would rather fight 100 duck sized horses because ducks are psycos in any size. If anyone is intrested. 

I will answer most of the questions left, slowly.

We first started puppeteering on the NYC subways in 2004, but we quickly realized that Mario and Fafa begging New Yorkers for change was not the way to do things.

So we moved to the interwebs and started making videos.

Since the puppets are more interesting than we are, we'll answer your questions with videos from the Glove and Boots character of your choice. (Mario, Fafa, Gorilla, Thor, Santa, Jack Woods,  Zombie, Stewart, etc.)

828,IAmA,"IAMA entrepreneur, Ironman, scaler of Mt Everest, and Presidential candidate. I'm Gary Johnson - AMA","I've been referred to as the ‘most fiscally conservative Governor’ in the country, was the Republican Governor of New Mexico from 1994-2003. I bring a distinctly business-like mentality to governing, believing that decisions should be made based on cost-benefit analysis rather than strict ideology.

I'm a avid skier, adventurer, and bicyclist. I have currently reached four of the highest peaks on all seven continents, including Mt. Everest.

**HISTORY &amp; FAMILY**

I was a successful businessman before running for office in 1994. I started a door-to-door handyman business to help pay my way through college. Twenty years later, I had grown the firm into one of the largest construction companies in New Mexico with over 1,000 employees. .

I'm best known for my veto record, which includes over 750 vetoes during my time in office, more than all other governors combined and my use of the veto pen has since earned me the nickname “Governor Veto.” I cut taxes 14 times while never raising them. When I left office, New Mexico was one of only four states in the country with a balanced budget.

I was term-limited, and retired from public office in 2003.

In 2009, after becoming increasingly concerned with the country’s out-of-control national debt and precarious financial situation, the I formed the OUR America Initiative, a 501c(4) non-profit that promotes fiscal responsibility, civil liberties, and rational public policy. I've traveled to more than 30 states and spoken with over 150 conservative and libertarian groups during my time as Honorary Chairman.

I have two grown children - a daughter Seah and a son Erik. I currently resides in a house I built myself in Taos, New Mexico.

**PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**

I've scaled the highest peaks of 4 continents, including Everest.

I've competed in the Bataan Memorial Death March, a 25 mile desert run in combat boots wearing a 35 pound backpack.

I've participated in Hawaii’s invitation-only Ironman Triathlon Championship, several times.

I've mountain biked the eight day Adidas TransAlps Challenge in Europe.

Today, I finished a 458 mile bicycle ""Ride for Freedom"" all across New Hampshire.

It was suggested by a handful of people that I come here and do this, so here we are. Feel free to ask whatever you like, but know that there are some questions I simply cannot answer.

831,IAmA,IAmA 25yo gay guy.  I want to anonymously thank all the many hetero people who support gay equality and make progress possible.,"I keep being amazed by how many straight people understand and support the issues of gay equality.  On Reddit and other places, I see hetero people stand up to bigots and argue for equality.  I read about polls showing that growing majorities support gay rights, especially young people by huge percentages.  People all over are finally calling out the hate groups and the bullies.  It's a great feeling and huge change from even a few years ago.  

LGBT are a tiny minority and always will be.  We grow up feeling weird and face a culture of bullying and organized, orchestrated hate from religious fanatics who make money and get votes by demonizing and degrading gay people. There's no way we could ever have a chance if it wasn't for the decency of a growing majority of straights.  

So I just wanted to anonymously say *thanks,* that's all."
832,IAmA,"I had a stage 4 brain tumor, AMA.","I was diagnosed with Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA) which is **NON CANCEROUS!!** at the age of 12.  It grows in the back of the nose, and in my case it began growing in my brain and behind my optic nerves, the surgery was a success and medical history was made. AMA.

Proof - http://imgur.com/h5e4P7O

/u/rbrychckn simplifies the document I used as proof:

""I'm in this field, so I thought I'd try to simplify the proof document that the OP supplied.
The Progress Notes section just lists the multiple procedures that were performed. The class of procedures this falls into is Endoscopic Skull-Base Surgery. A not-quite-the-same but conceptually accurate video is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ki26qyOuNU).
The ""Stereotactic image guidance"" is pretty new and takes a CT scan of the head that was taken before surgery and we place that on a computer screen in the operating room. Using bony landmarks on the head (tip of the nose, bones around the eyes), a set of many electrodes are placed on the face. A probe is used to point at a specific point and the computer shows you where that probe is on the CT scan. A good real-world view of what they look at is [here](http://nycfacemd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/53yo-female-BrainLAB-screen-300x245.jpg).

""IMAX ligation"" has nothing to do with 3D movies. It stands for internal maxillary artery ligation which means that this artery was tied off. This almost certainly means the OP's tumor was being supplied blood from here.
As others have noted, this is benign so it is not cancer. Staging of benign tumors do not have the same connotations as a stage IV terminal cancer. Nonetheless, this is dangerous mostly because of where it is (next to the brain) and any mass that continues to grow will erode into nearby structures even if it doesn't invade into them.

Last, the numbness that the OP is describing make sense as the tumor and the surgery was near the nasopalatine nerve that come through the inside of the nose down toward the roof of the mouth or palate. The lip numbness is tougher to explain anatomically but still make sense from what he went through.""


**Commonly asked questions**

*Lasting symptoms*

-I have numbness of my lip, the upper right portion, the roof of my mouth, and my nose.

-I can only cry out of one eye (left)


*Symptoms that made you check it out*

-Migraines weekly

-Constant stuffed right nostril

-A very chubby face, chubby cheeks, chubby underneath the eyes.  I looked very swollen. 

*Cognitive side affects*

-None 

*Did you die*

-No

*Did they let you keep it after surgery*

-No, they are using it for studies. 

*Did you have to start cooking meth*

-No, I'm not a chemistry teacher.

Why is it in the same threads that we interview famous people in? We should start a new section called MMFB (Make Me Feel Better). If something happened that was really terrible and you need a pick me up, this would be the place to post it. I'd be willing to start it, but if someone else wanted to be the admin that would be fine.

- I'm pretty much checking back on my phone. I didn't expect this to rise so quickly. To be honest, I care more about paying more attention to what we upvote in the AMA section that should really be in another subreddit. When I posted this, I hadn't yet made the thread, thinking someone else would go ahead and do it, but then I decided to just make it before some troll made it with a different name. If you would like to be the admin, I will check my inbox over the next day and add whoever seems legit enough...whatever that means.


-OKAY. I finally got home after a long day of being out. I'm very sorry for starting this at a time when I was going to be away from a computer all day and I couldn't really do much about it.

839,IAmA,"[IAmA Request] Alan Alda - Hawkeye Pierce from Mash, Dr. Gallo from 'And the Band Played On'","I think a lot of people see him and associate him with characters but aren't as familiar with his work in theater, or his father's work on the stage.   

His official website: http://www.alanalda.com/
Twitter: @The_Alan_Alda

Questions to ask: 

1.) I remember doing a report on you in middle school.  During my research I read about your struggle with polio at a young age.  Did you experience continued health issues associated with the recovery from it as you aged?   What is your most vivid memory of that difficult period of time in your life? 

2.)  It has been said you yourself are a Democrat.  What influences did you draw from in your portrayal of Senator Arnold Vinick in The West Wing?  Was it particularly difficult playing a Republican? Or did you find something about him that made him particularly appealing as a whole?  (I loved the character; but, was curious as to your impressions of him as a whole.) 

3.)  During your time playing Captain Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce, you had the opportunity to work with a lot of guest actors that made appearances on M * A * S * H over the years.  What was one of your most memorable experiences in terms of working with them? Which one stands out in your mind?

4.)  You have a Science Degree from Fordham University, yes?  Is it a General Bachelor of Science? Or did you have a specific focus?  What did you want to do with it, initially? 

5)  If there were three historical figures with whom  you could sit down for tea and talk, who would it be and what would you ask them?"

What was the weirdest/worst essay you have ever seen?

Do you look at applicant's facebook/twitter profiles?


EDIT: I'm adding more questions since a fair amount of them are being answered in this thread.

What answers is the college looking for when it asks ""why are you interested in college X""?

Has an interview with a candidate ever ruined their chances at acceptance, why?

How important is contact with admissions reps outside of the application? (e.g. emailing them telling them you are applying or visited ect.) 

Why do colleges want to know what other schools I am applying to? Does it affect the decision?

* Would you ever want to create and write your own TV show? If you did, would it be an animate series?

* Has Scientology had a major impact on your life and your writing?  How?

* Do you prefer comics/graphic novels to writing full novels or do you just find them and the artistic view more exciting? The Graveyard Book was the best of both worlds; will there be more like that?

847,IAmA,"As requested, IAmA man who was in an extended coma for a period of 4 months.  AMA.","In the spring of 2006, I was in a terrible car accident with fatalities in Florida, which left me severely injured.  I was unconscious in a hospital for a period of 4 months after massive head trauma.  The doctors had said it was a miracle that I survived, but I didn't escape unscathed - my thinking abilities have been reduced.  While I no longer have seizures, I slur and stutter occasionally and think a bit more slowly.  AMA.

My roommate is helping me by transcribing my responses, as I type very slowly and make lots of mistakes. 

edit:  Roommate here.  Tedsnake has had to retire a bit earlier than planned this evening, but I could tell he loved being able to interact with you guys.  He's particularly forthright and open with his experiences, moreso than anyone else I've met, and it's truly inspiring.  You made his night, his week maybe.  (And to be selfish for a minute, it was fun for me also!  He's got a hell of a sense of humor.)  This will likely end up being his permanent account, as I think I intrigued him when I explained reddit.  Feel free to PM questions or discussions. 

This was really nice, reddit.  Thank you.


edit 2:  Roommate again.  So Ted and I did this AMA last night til about midnight, and we wrapped it up early because of an issue he had with his blood sugar.  Long story short, he's taking a medicine (Prednisone) for a lung infection which is wreaking havoc on his sugar levels.  As a precaution, we took him to be checked out and they're keeping him for a bit.  I'll visit this afternoon, at which point I'll show him more of your responses and such.  I gave him a quick rundown on the phone a few minutes ago, and he was absolutely elated to hear of your kind words and support.  Thank you!

2b:  I feel like I'm almost abusing the account by saying things without Ted here with me, so I'm going to post on JJEE from here on out.  That's my personal account.

848,IAmA,"Per request, I am a person who accidentally killed someone. AMA.","I was a best man in a wedding in my hometown. I had to travel back to the state to visit my old friends and to partake in the wedding. On the first night there the other groomsmen and bridesmaids took me out on the town to welcome me back. After the bars closed I got onto a motorcycle with a good friend on the back, there was one helmet and she was wearing it. She was very drunk and not experienced in riding on the back of motorcycles. While making a left turn she jerked to the right, I can only assume she got scared from leaning into the turn, we made a quick jump to the right, hit a curb and it threw me off of the bike. I landed 15 feet from the contact point and she fell straight backwards. I ran back to her and she was unconscious but mostly unscathed. I called 911 just as my other friends pulled up behind me and tried to help us get out of there. I feared the worse and told them to leave knowing the police and ambulances were coming. The ambulances came and took us away in separate vehicles. She had complications (I have never been told what complications) and was induced into a coma. I was released with a stable fracture in my neck and taken to jail in my scrubs and neck brace. After 10 weeks her parents decided to take her off life support and she died shortly after. I was charged with Involuntary Vehicular Manslaughter and spent a year going from county jail to prison to a prison camp before being released. 
Those are the hard facts, the personal things I remember are what haunt me. When I got up after the accident I remember how much dirt I had in my mouth and how bad my neck was. Once I ran up to her my thinking was still to get out of there before being in trouble. Her shirt was pulled down over her shoulders and I remember fixing it and yelling for her to wake up. I have seen many people knocked out before and expected her to come to at any moment, it wasn't a busy street so traffic and other viewers weren't an issue. It only took me a minute or two to realize it was worse than a knockout and called 911. My other friends showed up and I told them to leave so they weren't involved. 


I sat down next to her and sobbed for what seemed like a week. When the ambulance showed up I was taken in a different vehicle than her and started to freak out, I was strapped down because of my neck injury and scared more than I have ever been. She was next to me in the ER and I strained everything to be able to look over at her, she was quickly taken away and I never saw her again.


I had been drinking, BAC .18, I had been a heavy drinker for years and even though it is almost triple the legal driving limit I wasn't ""that"" drunk. DO NOT think this in my way of saying I don't deserve the punishment I simply use this to explain how clear the moment was. I had no business riding a motorcycle, and was far out of line having someone else on the back.


The court proceedings were very difficult for me, I constantly was taken to court to have a continuance issued and come back in two weeks. After she passed they were able to charge me for the full conviction of killing my friend. Her family wrote an amazing letter supporting me and asking for leniency. Because of a no contact order directly in place after the accident I was not allowed to contact the family, not even to thank or apologize to them. 


The request asked ""how do you deal with it?"". Man, I don't know, it used to be day to day while I tried to drown myself in alcohol. Now I'm doing better, I'm in an amazing relationship with a woman I don't deserve and helps carry me through every aspect of my life. I am attending college and write to my victim's mother when I can. I tried to be as full rounded on this subject but I know there are tons of questions about the wreck, hospital, court, jail, prison, and the after effects. So please ask away. I know what I did was wrong and it sucks everyday, if you feel it's your job to tell me that, then fuck you.
Thanks Reddit, my life would be worse without you.


TL;DR: Drunk motorcycled a girl home from a wedding, hit a curb, fracturing his neck and knocking the girl unconscious. She's induced into a coma and 10 weeks later the family pulls the plug. OP gets a year in jail for involuntary vehicular manslaughter. Thank you carleverett.


edit: I hadn't mentioned the financial aspect of this event. I owe the state $108,000 and the hospital $380,000, I have a 15 year sentence. It was originally $488,000 that was owed to the state, they would call it owing the victims, the judge wanted to ""give me a chance"" and dropped it to $108,000 the rest I'll probably be sued for. Basically to get it expunged I need to pay off the $108,000 within the 15 years, which I wont be able to. After 15 years passes I could be arrested and booked then charged with a new 15 years and given whatever amount that is left to pay back. I will always be a felon.

edit: I need to get some sleep, I'll be back to answering more questions in a few hours. Thank you, Reddit.


edit: Thank you to all the positive comments on here, I am happy to be able to share and hopefully make a difference for some people. I will continue to answer some of your questions. I saw a few comments asking if I have a start up page to help pay off my restitution debts. Though I greatly appreciate the gesture, I couldn't take your money to pay for my mistakes. However I plan on starting my own business and doing speeches around schools as well as some outreach programs, when I get these set up I will come back and make it available for you to help me fund those organizations. 
Thank you Reddit for giving me more confidence and feeling comfortable with myself.

850,IAmA,"IAmA request: Dr. Oliver Sacks, doctor/neurologist and widely read author of 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat' and 'Awakenings' (which was made into a film starring Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams)","Dr. Sacks has a new book, ‘Hallucinations,’ due for release on the 8th November, so I am hopeful that he would be happy to do an AMA (although he would perhaps prefer a video response). However, as I’m pretty new to Reddit, I have no idea how these requests become a reality (the side panel info doesn’t seem to help me answer this).

Questions:

1.	Did your own prosopagnosia (for redditors : face blindness - not being able to recognise people you see every day) have any influence on your chosen career path? If it did not, can you please tell us what did. 
2.	You rarely, if ever, talk about your feelings towards the cases of the many patients you have written about; there must surely be some emotional fall-out for you; can you please talk us through some of the cases that have affected you the most, and how you cope with not being able to solve people’s problems.
3.	I suspect you have inspired countless people to take up scientific careers; that aside, what would you like your legacy to be?
4.	What is the single-most neurological or neuropsychological challenge you would like to see better understood or ‘solved’ within the next 20 years?
And one just for me, because I’m sad you’re not in England: 
5.	You’re from England but have lived in New York for nearly 40 years; what led you to leave England and what has kept you in New York for so many years?

855,IAmA,"I rode a motorbike alone from The Netherlands to Nepal (17.000km/3months). I  travelled through countries like Iran, Turkmenistan and Pakistan. AMA","A couple of years ago I left my home in Boskoop, The Netherlands to travel to Nepal, Asia.

EDIT: This puts it in perspective:

http://www.boskoop2nepal.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image11.png


During that trip I visited Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgistan, China, Pakistan, India and Nepal.

Preparation (getting the bike ready, visa's, etc.) took about 6 months. I left in the spring and returned (by plane) 3 months later.

I kept a blog during the trip; it's still more or less on-line: www.boskoop2nepal.nl

EDIT 3: Ok, about to go to bed, will check tomorrow for any unanswered questions.

Often asked questions:

-Sex?

It's hard to get lucky in an Islamic country.


-What bike?

Honda Africa Twin. I bought the bike specifically for the trip. It was 2nd hand, imported from Italy (not by me) with 28000km on the odometer. I modded the bike: bigger fuel tank (44liter), GPS (Garmin), heated grips, huge airhorn, steel tube protection frame, aluminium panniers, etc. Also a full service &amp; new tires. All together I think the bike &amp; luggage weighs around 350kg.

-Navigation?

I took maps along of every part of my route. All can be bought online. The GPS helps, nut mostly you just follow the road/path to the next town/village. That can be anywhere from 10km to 600km. Locals can tell you how to get to the next village (but usually not further, they don't know/never been).

-Visa?

Before leaving, I organised all the required visas. Some I got in The Netherlands (The Hague) and for some I had to go to Brussels. It's a hassle, it costs a lot of money, but there is no way around it. You can get agencies to do it for you, but that can cost a lot of money. You can find them on the net.

The Turkmen visa was the hardest to get. Normally, you can only travel in Turkmenistan with a guide 24/7. But there is a loophole: you can get a transit visa which allows you to enter, travel, and leave. So I told them that I would be entering from Iran in order to go to Uzbekistan. I asked for 6 days visa, considering the distance I would be travelling that would give me a day to visit the capital and an extra day in case of emergencies.

-Money?

Some of the countries visited were cash only (for example Iran, Turkmenistan), others have ATM's (for example Pakistan, India, Nepal, China). So you have to bring lots of US$ with you (yes, they accept the US$ anywhere, really anywhere). I carried some on my body, and some was hidden on the bike.

-Costs (EURO)?

Bike was about 3-4K, I spend about 7K along the way, flight back &amp; bike shipping about 2K, paperwork &amp; guides 1K. Add maybe 1K for things I forgot.

-Dangers?

I took a security course in the UK before I left. They cater to journalists &amp; tourists that go to 'difficult' countries. Their analysis was that the biggest danger would be the traffic in India! I took normal precautions, and was never at 1 place for more that a few days. So usually if I would have attracted any attention, I was gone before they really noticed me. But I never really felt in danger. I never travelled at night and almost always slept in hotes/hostels/family homes where the bike was parked in a safe place. Sometimes that would be inside, next to the reception. And, no, I didn't bring any guns (why Americans have such a fascination for guns, I'll never understand).

Contrary to popular opinion, crime rates in most of these countries are very low. In some you have more to fear from the police/military than the population. They tend to be extremely welcoming, friendly &amp; curious.

-Repairs/spare parts

I took a pair of tires with me to switch just before Turkmenistan. I also sent a pair ahead to China, together with oil &amp; air filters. I carried a lot of spares, because after Istanbul, it's really hard if not impossible to get anything for such a (big) bike. I suffered no problems, except a flat tire in China due to a huge iron nail. I also carried spare inner tubes and an airpump. I'm quite handy with tools &amp; repairs, so that was no problem. I took plenty tools along.

-Food &amp; lodging

You can get food anywhere (duh), and they have hotels and restaurants anywhere (duh), although they may not look/taste/smell like anything you've ever seen. A restaurant can be a roadside shack and a hotel can turn out not to have any water .. I always carried a lot of water on the bike, and I had some camping/survival food with me, just in case. I also carried a tent, sleeping bag and simple cooking set. I camped in the desert of Iran and Turkmenistan (amazing).

-Route (loop in China)

I wanted to cross the desert, and I took the Cross Desert Highway, 600km of sand, sand and then some more sand. So I made that loop (clockwise). Cool, you can see that desert from space!

-General

I found people on average everywhere very friendly and sympathetic to my travels. People in remote places are thrilled to see strangers visit them, especially someone from that far away, all alone on a motorcycle. Poor people relate different to motorcycles then we do. For them it's the transportation of the poor, the rich have cars, the poor ride bikes .. so if you're on a bike, even from the west, you can't be rich .. that decreases the distance / creates empathy.

I also 'discovered' that:

-governments suck, not people

-Iranians don't hate the west, they want the best for their childern as well

-Northern Pakistan is the most beautiful place on earth (or maybe Tikal, Guatemala)"
856,IAmA,IAMA novice soccer coach that led the 'worst team in the world' to their first ever international victory. AMA,"I, Matt Conrad, and my mate Paul after a few beers had the crazy idea to ditch the drudgery of life and pursue our dream of playing international soccer.  One problem: Who would take us? Neither of us were what you would call ""talented.""

A few more beers and some Googling later we found the island of Pohnpei, a tiny speck in the Pacific Ocean. Pohnpei had never won a game and were called ""the worst team in the world."" Perfect! - we thought. Let's grab a camera, pop over to the other side of the world, wow the locals with some kick-ups, play a game, win and become local legends forever! 

Not exactly. 

After a 48 hour flight we touched down on an island unlike anything we had ever seen. It was beautiful, very weird and everyone was staring at us. We bee-lined to team practice anxious to meet our new team-mates. But lo and behold - there was no team at all! 

From this moment our mission became clear: Help Pohnpei create something pure and noble to call their own - a team capable of competing and winning their first game. Away from the over-commercialized trappings and glitz of the modern game, we had the chance to do something truly grass roots. Our mission became an obsession. 

But, building a team in the middle of nowhere in the stifling heat and driving rain with no funding is no easy feat. Especially on a waterlogged field inhabited by hundreds of toads and dogs. Recruiting players and bridging the enormous cultural gap to instill a professional discipline needed to compete at international level wasn't any easier. Our star player was run over and almost killed by a drunk driver, our funding repeatedly fell through, I got 3rd degree sun burns, Paul got boils - yes boils, ...and we didn't have a working toilet. Nevertheless, inspired by our players, many of whom walked miles to and from training in the pummeling rain, we flew them off the island (in many cases for their first time) to face island rivals and Pacific soccer powerhouses, Guam in Pohnpei's first competitive game in decades. 

We won.

tl:dr With no money and experience I flew to a small Pacific Island and coached their soccer team to their first international victory.

857,IAmA,"I grew up on a sailboat and am about to embark on the first crossing of the South Atlantic on a boat with no motor or cabin, AMA.","Hello Reddit, my name is Igor Bely. Along with my friend Beto, I plan to cross the South Atlantic in a few weeks. It will be a great journey as we will sail without a motor or cabin. This is the second leg of a circumnavigation of the globe on a sport catamaran. We have already crossed the Pacific ocean previously and hopefully we will continue with the Indian Ocean.

We will go from Cape town to Rio de Janeiro in a sports catamaran. We will only be using clean energy for this journey and we hope to demonstrate that tough challenges can be met without conventional energy. Since I grew up on a boat where we always had to be frugal with our resources, this is a cause I strongly believe in. I will be happy to answer any questions you have about our trip and everything involved with it.

858,IAmA,I am a REAL 35 year old man with micropenis and it has been a detrimental affect on my life.  Pics with proof included.

Album and YES it is a dead dove result.

YES, the second picture is me fully erect.

Edit: Just...wow.  So much positivity.  Thanks all of you.  A couple points for the broken records:

I was mirco BEFORE the weight.  Now I am micro and buried in fat.

Penis, before weight gain was 3-1/4"" long (and that was pushing the ruler in as deep as I could) and under an inch in diameter which means short and very skinny.

Thanks for all the weight lose advice.  Working on.  Already undergone radical diet changes and such.  /keto, /paleo and so on have been suggested.  Message received.  I am a Fatty Mc Faterson that needs to eat healthy and exercise.

Currently 4:30am, time has flown.  Will hang on a little while longer.

Edit 2: Found out I don't medically meet the definition of micropenis.  My apologies.  How about supertinypenis instead?  My whole life is a lie!  Point being, I'm in the bottom percentile, the smallest condoms are like baggies on it.

Edit 3: Obligatory holy crap, made the main page and its on a throwaway.  Curses!

Edit 4: For those that haven't read, life is back on track.  Eating much healthier for a while now and weight is slowly coming off.  I have a wife and she likes my supertinypenis.

Edit 5:  4:15pm, 8/25/12 Wow, this really blew up.  About to get off work.  I will try to address more questions as soon as I can.

860,IAmA,AMA Request: An average joe who has dated someone famous.,"Preferably after a male who has dated a famous female actress/singer/model, but a female who has dated a male would also suffice. And when I say famous, I mean household name famous (Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, Leo Decaprio, Morgan Freeman, etc.) 

*How did you handle the lifestyle difference?

*Were you ever harassed by paparazzi?

*Cool stories of events, etc that you attended

*How did your life change while you were dating, and how did it change after dating that person?

*How did you meet/begin dating?


CLARIFICATION: They need have already 'blown up' for it to count. Not overly interested in someone who dated a celebrity before they were famous. 

Edit 1: The best suggestion so far is Baby Spoon, Kesha's boyfriend. A quick google search suggests he is part of her road crew but not really famous himself, however I'm having no luck finding any facebook/twitter/email info for him, just links to infant products. 

Edit 2: Seems this request has been asked quite a few times. There has been an interesting ama done by someone who dated Kyle Gass from Tenacious D. Was probably aiming for someone a touch more famous than him, but it is still a very interesting read.

I am a Fellow and Vice President of Technical Strategy for IBM Research at the Thomas J Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. Prior to this, I led the research team that created the first 1-gigahertz RISC processor chip, and was responsible for the group that developed the ISA Systems Bus, an integral component for making [the first Personal Computers](http://www.ibm.com/ibm100/us/en/icons/personalcomputer/) possible.

It seems like there are many kindred spirits here on Reddit, so I thought it’d be fun to come on today and answer any questions you might have about computer science, engineering, programming, your first PC -- you name it.

As tempting as it is, I still have a day job and can’t stay on all day, but I’ll be checking in for the next half-hour, again at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, and then later this afternoon at 4:30 to answer as many questions as I can.

So go ahead, ask me anything!

**Edit:** Hey everyone, I had no idea I'd get so many questions! This is great, and I'm going to try to answer as many as possible. I can only check in periodically throughout the day, though, so thanks for being patient with me. Keep 'em coming! "

872,IAmA,I recently won £1m on the lottery AMA,"I won in October last year. I was working full-time but have quit to get this money properly sorted. Obviously a lot has changed for me so AMA.

EDIT: thanks for playing, I'm off to buy a monocle, fire some advisors, and give money to a Nigerian prince.
I'll try answer any remaining questions later. BYE

Clarifications: 
I have seen over 13 different advisors, 2 of which I already know other wealthy people that use them.
When I say I want a sporty car, I mean like £6k on a good (but used) mx-5 or something.
I never said I haven't given any to friends or family already, all I said was I won't give to those begging for it.
My wife still works and I will again (soon) and we already have property to rent out. 
And many of you seem to think my friends NEED financial help when most of them are doing well for themselves.

873,IAmA,"AMA Request: Air Traffic Controller (ATC) working on September 11, 2001.","Prompted by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/15xd1j/a_friend_posted_these_on_facebook_flight_strips/) /r/flying thread, I and a bunch of other redditors were wondering what it was like to have been working as an air traffic controller on that horrible day.  


Questions per IAmA Rules:

1. What was it like to issue the ""NO FLY"" call to the aircraft you were monitoring? Scary? Exciting? Sad?

2. Did any pilots question the legitimacy of what you were saying? Were they hesitant to divert and land?

3. How tense was the tower during and after the attacks?

4. Did any of the ATCs or yourself stop to watch the news? How were you informed otherwise?

5. Were you allowed to go home at your regular scheduled time, or were you requested to stay after and help manage some of the sure-to-be chaos?

**EDIT**: To those who are offended by this request, I would really like to apologize. I am the son of a flight attendant, but even I had no idea how taboo the general subject was to those in aviation. "

Sleeping Pad- $100
Carpet - $10
Platform - $30 mostly recylced wood
Tint - $100

GUNPOINT STORY:
Went to bed about 11:30 parked in front of my shop on the street. Woke up at 12AM to cops screaming with their flashlights and guns held out telling me not to fucking move, don't fucking touch anything! I got out, in my boxers, and they proceeded to search me. I ended up on the curb for 10 minutes in my underwear while they berated me, telling me times are tough but you're not allowed to do this, what drugs are you on, etc. etc. They found nothing, they said to leave. I did a U-Turn, opened the gate to the shop, drove in, locked it and gave them the finger.

879,IAmA,IAmAn 18-year-old girl who had a breast reduction 6 months ago. I'm back with progress photos and here to answer anything you want to know. AMA,"I had my surgery on May 18, and I'm 18 years old. I got it done mostly because of back pain, rashes from skin-on-skin contact, posture problems, and to increase my quality of life (self-esteem and whatnot)

Here are the basic questions I get:

**How much did it cost?**

Around $5,000, and insurance didn't cover. My parents paid.

**What size were you before? And now?**

I was a 32G and now I'm around a 34D.

**Why would you get it/You're slapping God in the face/People pay for big boobs**

I had really bad back pains, dents in my shoulders, rashes under them... blah blah.

**How much boobage did they remove?**

They took around 3/4lb from each, so, about 1 1/2 lbs overall. (293g from the left tit and 281 from the right)

**Will the scars fade?**

They'll always be there, but they will turn white as time goes on. I don't care. I'd rather have scars than have my boobs how they were before.

**Did they give you a lift?**

Yes! Typical reductions (except in the uncommon cases in which it's liposuction only) essentially take a wedge out of your boobs and move the nipple up.  It results in a lifted breast.

**Did they make your areolas smaller?**

Yep. It's procedure, and I see it as a bonus.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/TWVNR) (NSFW) is my progress album with proof.  RES users are encouraged to click on the link for captions because they can be quite gruesome out of context.

Anyways, AMA and I'm looking forward to your thoughts.

890,IAmA,AMA Request: A Colorado Lawyer who knows this new law inside and out...,"I think America has questions.  We can all guess, but who wants to guess when someone could still land their butt in jail.  

1) What does everyone need to know about this law?  

2) What does no one know about this law that they should?

3) When does this take place.

4) What restrictions can we expect.

5) What if I live out of state and want to buy while I'm there?

6) What if I want to start selling there?  "

892,IAmA,"I have terminal cancer, and will be flying out to Switzerland to organise my affairs with Dignitas AMAA.","I am twenty-three years of age, and tomorrow I will be flying out to Switzerland to start the four month process  of being assisted in suicide. I have chosen Dignitas to help me end my life, and I thought I would answer some questions from Reddit. I have terminal lung, and bronchial cancer, and my quality of life, and the amount of medication I need to take to live some form of normality is no longer worth it to me. I have posted proof to the moderators, and have chosen to remain anonymous as assisted suicide is not legal in my country, and their is no form of protection which would stop my family members being charged with assisting my suicide.

898,IAmA,"I am John Resig, creator of jQuery, AMA.","Hi All! I've been asked to do an AMA and thought I'd tackle it when I have some more time - which is now! Most likely you know me as the creator and lead developer of the jQuery JavaScript library.

I first started working on jQuery sometime during 2005, while I was still in college, in order to alleviate much of the stress that I felt when trying to build cross-platform web applications. I was hacking on a number of projects at the time and had a couple hacky libraries I was using. I ended up merging them together, refining them a bit, and turning them into what is now called 'jQuery'.

Some more details about me and my projects can be found on my web site: http://ejohn.org/

Yesterday was the release of jQuery 1.6 and I just announced that I'm leaving the Mozilla Corporation to go work at Khan Academy:
http://ejohn.org/blog/next-steps-in-2011/

I'm a long time Reddit user as well (since 2006). I remember first hearing about it from Paul Graham back in 2005 but was still an ardent Digg user. I actually applied to be in the original Y Combinator program in 2005 but ended up getting rejected. Applied again in 2006, got in, and moved to Boston. While there I met Alexis (one of the creators of Reddit) and said something like ""Reddit seems neat, but a bit too high brow and boring."" Needless to say, I was a full-time user within the month. I remember going to at least a couple of their rooftop parties in Cambridge and one of my friends even sublet one of their rooms for a while.

I'm the creator and moderator of a large number of sub-reddits (about 53). I'm the creator of the following 5k+ user sub-reddits: sex, news, boston, javascript, travel, coding, photos, opensource, religion, google, haskell, firefox, mac, and europe. I'm also a moderator of fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu and relationship_advice. I use to own 'blog' but turned it over to the Reddit team (for a while they forgot to turn off my ability to submit new posts - but it's since been disabled - I should've used it when I had the chance!).

My favorite sub-reddits are fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu and starcraft. I read every f7u12 comic every day and I watch more casted Starcraft games than any other form of media (movies and TV included).

I recently realized, after talking with Max Goodman (@chromakode) - one of the new hires at Reddit - that I really need to start getting more involved in helping to improve Reddit. I dipped my toe in by providing an improvement to f7u12:
http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/gwm95/rage_faster_fixed/

I recently started working on a new Node.js-based web application that will alleviate much of the stress that sub-reddit moderators feel (by allowing users to self-moderate themselves). I hope to have it done soon, message me if you moderate a sub-reddit and are interested in helping test it out.

So that this AMA isn't completely code and reddit-centric, here are some more things that I love:

* Art: I paint a little bit, collect a lot, study even more.
* Japanese Woodblock Printing: I study this art form extensively and I'm working to start the /r/ukiyoe sub-reddit. This is my primary interest outside of coding.
* Cooking and Food: Love cooking, cook meals almost every day. Travel extensively looking for great, hard-to-find, food.
* Movies and TV: Love film, go to film festivals, watch way too much good TV.
* Board games: Have 1-2 board games nights per week, my recent favorite is Hansa Teutonica.

That's all for now - ask away!

900,IAmA,"IAmA 92 year old Azerbaijani World War II veteran. I was conscripted to fight for the Soviets, captured by the Germans, surrendered on the Western front, married a German woman and started a new life in the US. AMA","We're Matt (/u/nitroswingfish) and Mouna, and we'll be typing out the answers for Mouna's Opa (German for grandfather), Michael Mirson (born Mikhail Mirsayef - or as other family members in Azerbaijan write it Mirzeyev). We'll answer the questions in the first person (and where possible we will quote him verbatim to give you a feel for his level of English), and get to as many as possible. Opa gets tired pretty easily, so we will take breaks throughout the day, and if necessary we'll answer more tomorrow. Here's our summary of his story:
 
 
**Pre-War**

Born on a farm in Armenia, my father was taken to Siberia never to be seen again when I was 10 years old. The Soviets used the farm as a collective farm, killed our honey bees, and confiscated all of the livestock. At 16, I escaped from the farm and fled to Yerevan, Armenia. I managed to enter veterinary school, attended for three years, and was conscripted into the Soviet army in 1941. 
 
 
**War in the Caucasus**

The Germans soon pushed into the Caucasus Mountains, probably heading for oil-rich Baku, Azerbaijan, and the Soviets defended fiercely. While fighting in the mountains I was injured from a hand grenade explosion, with over 26 shrapnel pieces in my body. I was transported to Sochi on the Black Sea to a hospital and in November I was sent back out to fight back in the mountains. 

While fighting again the Germans surrounded our battalion, with fighting on all of our sides. I remember an explosion while I charged with my rifle and I was knocked out, awaking to a German kicking me in the back. My finger was hanging from my hand and was bandaged. Germans took our overcoats, and we suffered heavily through the night, with nearly half of my fellow soldiers freezing. Somehow I survived. We marched for four days into a valley that separated Georgia from Russia.

I was marched to a prison camp in a small city in southern Russia called Maykop, where I stayed for about three months. The Russians were advancing on the German position and we were given the choice of marching with the Germans or facing our Russian comrades who would, in our eyes, most definitely kill us for surrendering. Most chose to march towards German lines, though many died during that march. With so many wounded horses I was given the chance to show my veterinary skills and was given a position as an assistant veterinarian for almost three years with the German veterinarian.
 
 
**The War Ends**

Eventually we ended up in Austria, where we were fighting the oncoming Russians. A high ranking German officer came to speak to us. He told us the war was over. He told us we were on our own, and that the American line was about 50km west. He warned us that the Russian line would be more dangerous, but we only had about 5 or 6 hours to make it to the Russian line. 
 
 
**Fleeing to the American Lines**

Taking my time and giving my horse plenty of rest, I made it to the American line and was put into a camp as a German prisoner. With other Soviets, I convinced the American commander that we were not Germans, and just like that he let us go. I found work on a farm in Austria. When we learned that the area of Austria we were in was possibly part of Czechoslovakia, which would be Soviet territory, and fearing for our lives, we fled to an UNRA refugee camp in Germany and sought work.
 
 
**Post-War and moving to the US**

As a free man, I eventually met my wife in Amberg, Germnay, married in 1946 and had two children (including Mouna's mother). After that we came to the US by boat in 1951 in hopes of something better (my first choice was actually to move to Australia, but at the Australian consulate I was rejected because I am a Muslim). We had another child, lived and worked on farms, lived in New York City, worked any job necessary, moved to Boston, owned a diner, had a stroke, and live happily with our three daughters, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

905,IAmA,Hi I am Dr. Matt Oliva. My Mission: Rid the Developing World of Treatable Blindness. Ask me anything!,"I am an ophthalmologist and corneal surgeon and am deeply passionate about international service. I am a board member of the Himalayan Cataract Project (cureblindness.org) – a non-profit foundation aimed at eliminating treatable blindness in the developing world. 

I’ve traveled all over the globe, from Ethiopia to Nepal, to perform, and more importantly, to teach cataract surgery. While cataracts are usually an issue for the elderly in the US, cataracts are the leading cause of treatable blindness for people of all ages in the developing world. So far, the HCP team has restored sight to more than 260,000 children and adults in the most unreachable parts of the Himalayas and Sub-Saharan Africa with effective, high-quality cataract operations, and has trained hundreds of eye care professionals to treat their own citizens. 

A new book just came out that describes some of the work I’ve done and tells the story of my incredible colleagues and co-founders of HCP, Dr. Geoff Tabin and Dr. Sanduk Ruit. The book is called Second Suns: Two Doctors and Their Amazing Quest to Restore Sight and Save Lives. 

The book was featured in the [Washington Post] (http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-14/opinions/39972898_1_three-cups-cataract-second-suns)

Dr. Tabin spoke about HCP on [Huffington Post Live](http://live.huffingtonpost.com/#r/archive/segment/inside-the-himalayan-cataract-project/51b8e3a178c90a0927000121) recently.

906,IAmA,"I am Vanessa Selbst, the highest earning female poker player, and a member of Team Pokerstars Pro. Ask me Anything!","Hey everyone - I'm [Vanessa Selbst](http://www.vanessaselbstpoker.com).  

I started playing poker about 9 years ago, just messing around with friends.  I then learned about online poker and online poker forums, got serious about the game, and starting building my bankroll in cash games.  In 2006, I played my first couple of tournaments and made my first televised final table at the WSOP.  I somewhat infamously busted 4-bet shoving 52s and running into AA in a hand that Norman Chad referred to as a ""blowup of monumental proportions"" or something along those lines.

Though I had some early success, I struggled with the idea of making poker a long-term career as I wasn't convinced it was sustainable as a way of contributing to a healthy and meaningful life, so I went to law school in 2008.  While there, I played and won a few tournaments including the NAPT Mohegan Sun for $750,000.  That win catalyzed my signing with Pokerstars and my return to a career as a pro, this time as a tourney donkey rather than a cash game pro who dabbled in tournaments.  I'm still not convinced poker as a career is fully healthy or meaningful, but I'm doing everything I can to make it that.

I have since graduated from law school and also become the highest earning female poker player of all time, [with more than $7 million in career earnings, ](http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&amp;n=68149) and a bunch of tournament wins.

I am also, incidentally, a lesbian, and a strong supporter of civil rights (LGBT and otherwise).  I am engaged to my wonderful fiancee and will be married in August of this year in New York.

I'll be back in 2 hours - at 2PM Pacific time.  What do you wanna know?

OK - it's about that time to head out.  I've had a lot of fun with this... thanks reddit, you've made me a fan for life!"

914,IAmA,"IAmA Director of an ISP who was the first person to ever challenge the constitutionality of the USA PATRIOT Act's ""National Security Letter"" provision.  AMA. ","I was concerned with the legitimacy of the National Security Letter (NSL) [I received](http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/4610_001_redactednsl.pdf) and I had concerns that the client was being targeted because of political speech.  I believed the FBI was demanding personal, sensitive, and constitutionally-protected information about one of my company's clients.   I have to be extremely careful about what I say when I speak on this topic due to the on-going gag.   I am allowed to say that the NSL sought a client’s name, address, telephone number, length of service, and transactional records including “transaction/activity logs,” “email header information,” account number, billing, email addresses, and anything I “considered to be an [electronic communication transactional record](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080606111.html).”

I refused to comply with the demand for information.  Instead, I called my lawyer and together, we paid a visit to one of the clients of my ISP - the NYCLU - New York Civil Liberties Union - affiliate of the ACLU.  Subsequently, I decided to file a challenge to the constitutionality of NSLs.  After a few bizarre and Kafkaesque discussions (*Q: had I broken the gag order by telling my lawyer? A: according to a literal reading of the NSL, yes I broke it several times over telling my lawyer, the NYCLU lawyer, and the ACLU lawyers.  Q: would a hood be put over my head and would I be dragged away for violating the gag by telling lawyers and filing a suit? A: nobody knew for sure - the original law was unclear as to the penalty*) I became the plaintiff in a court case originally known as ""[Doe v. Ashcroft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_v._Ashcroft)"" which was filed in 2004.    If you have been following [the news recently](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Tea-Party-Tally/2011/0209/Patriot-Act-upset-vote-Can-tea-party-lawmakers-liberals-be-friends) you will see that 7 years later, the after-effects of the constitutional challenge are still being felt.  

As the years passed and the person who held the office of Attorney General changed, the case was renamed from Doe v. Ashcroft to Doe v. Gonzales, and then to Doe v. Mukasey, and finally Doe v. Holder.  

The constitutional challenge resulted in the NSL provision being [repeatedly](http://www.lawsof.com/page/U.S.-District-Court-Strikes-Down-Statutory-Amendments-Made-by-U.S.-Patriot-Act.html) declared [unconstitutional](http://www.technewsworld.com/rsstory/59218.html) in the courts. ( As an aside, it was also ruled unconstitutional in [another case in Oregon](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/packet/200710/district-court-strikes-down-patriot-act%E2%80%99s-amendments-foreign-intellige) )  However due to procedural reasons/tactics ( e.g. the law being changed which sent the case back down to the lower court, the request for information being dropped - undercutting my right to challenge the law on 4th amendment grounds ) the case was prevented from ever reaching the Supreme Court and therefore the rulings were not binding on the FBI.  However the law was amended to fix some of the violations.  Also, we have learned a lot of information after the DoJ Inspector General performed [several](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/03/fbi_misuses_und/) [audits](http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6202763&amp;nav=QEMt) of the use of NSL's and found [widespread abuse](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032000921.html).  For years, these developments were in the news and NSLs were debated in congress.  I have strong views about the need for reform of the NSL statute and it is hard to accurately describe my frustration at being unable to participate in the public debate.

In 2007, on the campaign trail, then-candidate Obama said that during his Presidency there would be ""*no more National Security Letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime*"" because ""*that is not who we are, and it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists.*""   Unfortunately so far that promise has not yet come true.  In fact, their use has reached epidemic levels.  To get a sense of how many of these letters have been used - during just a 3 year period between 2003 and 2006 the FBI put out nearly *1 NSL per 1000 Americans*.  I don't believe there can possibly be that many terrorism or espionage suspects in the country.

For the years I was completely gagged, I read about my case in the newspapers and on websites, I read people commenting about it but I couldn't say a thing.  I heard my friends and particularly my colleagues discuss the case without knowing I was the plaintiff.  I would have liked to have organized the ISP community to speak out against warrantless searches but I was unable to.  Now I feel that I have 7 years of lost time to make up for.

As part of a settlement agreement, I became partially un-gagged in August 2010.  After I was partially released from the gag order I have been speaking out at every opportunity, to let people know why this is so wrong.  I have been profiled in the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/business/media/10link.html?r=1), [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/09/AR2010080906252.html), and in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/08/nsl-gag-order-lifted/) magazine.  I have appeared on [National Public Radio](http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2011/01/21/04) and on the [Democracy Now!](http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/11/gagged_for_6_years_nick_merrill) radio show.

Sometimes when people ask what being partially un-gagged means, I explain it this way: If there were 100 things I couldn't say before, now there are 98 things I can't say.  Anything that was ever redacted in the court documents is something I can't discuss under penalty of law, and there is the possibility of prosecution if I mess up any time I discuss the issue. However I feel that it is important enough to take that risk, because the very bedrock principles our country was founded upon are at stake.   I think the FBI has abused its gag power to squelch debate on the issue.  There are recipients of hundreds of thousands of NSLs out there - some of the recipients of those letters might be reading this right now - who cannot talk openly without fear of going to prison.

Internet users do not give up their privacy rights when they log on, and the FBI should not have the power to secretly demand that ISPs turn over constitutionally protected information about their clients without a court order. I hope my successful challenge to the FBI's NSL gag power will empower others who may have received NSLs to speak out.

I am now in the fund-raising stage of building a non-profit organization called [The Calyx Institute](http://www.calyxinstitute.org/) that will offer ISP services and telco services (VOIP), perform legal advocacy and defense, and also produce educational materials - and whose missions are to promote best practices in the telecom industry with regards to privacy and to protect the sovereignty of digital communications.  It is currently seeking a development director, by the way.  However, I should stress that I am writing this as an individual, not in my capacity as Director of that organization.  AMA.  However I may not be able to answer all questions due to the gag order.

tl/dr : I sued the FBI over the unconstitutionality of national security letters and was gagged for over 6 years

I am a reporter for ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news organization. Twitter: [@kim_barker](http://twitter.com/Kim_Barker)

I cover campaign finance, focusing mainly on “dark money” groups, the social welfare nonprofits that spend millions on political ads and don’t disclose their donors. (Think Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity.) While I also write about super PACs, super PACs have to report their donors. Before coming to ProPublica, I was the Edward R. Murrow press fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. There, I wrote a book about my five years covering the war on terror, pinballing between Afghanistan and Pakistan for The Chicago Tribune. It’s called “The Taliban Shuffle,” and it’s written with a dark sense of humor. (Occasionally, I bring the funny to campaign finance, but that’s more of a challenge.)

IWAE (I Won’t Answer Everything). No questions about a certain former Pakistani prime minister, for example, and since I don’t really focus on the individual candidates and their fundraising, I’m not the best person to ask about that particular horse race. But on dark money, I’m your person.

•Fire lasted for 8 hours and no one could go back to their cabins since the smoke filled most and the heat was unbearable.
•We mostly sat around in lawn chairs for that day.
•You couldn't walk past most of the public restrooms without holding your breath because of the stench and the lower levels had wet, smelly carpets and were uncomfortably hot.
•On the 11th, people started taking their mattresses out on decks and slept outside (we did this as well).

921,IAmA,IAmA Icelandic woman who has lived in the US for 15 years and I think that the majority of American women need a reality check.,"Since moving here I have met too many women that are under the impression that they are pretty pretty princesses and as such should not have to do anything but get everything they want. It is their way or no way. They are rude, self righteous and believe they are entitled to everything.
 
They treat their men badly and barely care about their children. They grew up believing that their wedding day is the most important day in their lives and that their main focus throughout their life should be to find some guy that is supposed to grovel before them to marry. 

Not all women are that way but a a great majority as I have seen.
Many of my girl friends have infuriated me with their behavior and attitude towards their boyfriends/husbands, treating them like they were stupid and just plain being unreasonable cause they think that is ok and that is the way they should be. 
Why do you raise your children like that? Why do you continue to behave like that? Some women even acknowledge that how they are behaving is childish and rude but still do it because that ""is just the way it is"".

Edit: wow, I did not realize that this tiny insignificant post would get such a reaction. Thank you all for the interesting and insightful comments. It seems people either give a resounding ""yes"" or a ""up yours"" :D 
Some people seem to have misunderstood my statement to mean that Icelandic women are perfect or European women are awesome, this is not so. We all have our faults. This post is about the attitude I continually seem to run into here in the US. I maybe wrong, perhaps my sample group is to small or not varied enough. But so far this is what I see. Thanks again for all the input. 

Edit2: I just wanted to say thanks again to everyone who commented on this thread, I tried to respond to as many as I could but kind of stared in awe at my monitor when the comments hit a thousand O_O  It appears that I hit a nerve here and interestingly enough we all seem to be split down the middle at this point. I really have enjoyed reading your comments (both good and bad) and it has given me lots of food for thought. 
Also, it seems that my comment on where I live got lost somewhere in there, so: I live in Northern California. I am 31 and yes I do have some awesome down to earth, hard working girl friends. I am married (big wooooot! to my hubby for standing up for me more then a few times. Love you baby &lt;3) so no I can't marry you sorry. Yes I have seen a grown man naked and no Icelandic women are not perfect. Cheers and thanks for a very interesting day everyone. "

I realize that maybe some of these questions maybe answered elsewhere and/or common knowledge, but I haven't followed Mr. Collins' exploits since he's left Top Gear.  Since there has yet to be an AmA from him, I think it would be interesting to see some off-the-cuff answers from the man with a helmet for a face.

Questions: 

1. Aside from doubling as James Bond, whats next for you?
1. Since you had very little to say on the show, were there times when you had a strong opinion on something, if so, have any examples?
1. Not many people have the opportunity to teach a celebrity something new, which celeb did you get along with the most, which one was the biggest pain in the arse?
1. I understand that tensions were pretty high when you decided to reveal yourself as the Stig.  Between the BBC trying to prevent your book from being published and Jeremy's rantings, describe your current relationships with the other three presenters off-screen.
1. What's your favorite, every-day car and why?

Edit:  Wow, didn't expect this response!  I hope the word gets out to him.  Seems like there is still a bit of controversy over the man in reading the comments, but that should make for a good AMA... in my own mind.

[–]onthestorm 32 points 1 hour ago
OK, enough people (even personal emails) asked me to come by. I'll take any excuse to procrastinate from writing.

1. Nope. Unless you count that the last season I started dating one of the show's production assistants (the showbiz equivalent of an intern). We were together for 7 years.
Although, I will say that when she was guest starring on the show, I was in love with Linda Cardellini. She thought I was too young for her. Boo.

2. Bill Daniels. Jesus, I'm joking. No one was an asshole.

3. ABC and the show runners decided that there were too many other shows in our demographic with ""nerd"" characters (Urkel, etc.). So they went a different direction.

4. Yep. We got to the point where we barely had to rehearse -- acting with Ben became like having a psychic twin.

5. Maybe, but I guess I don't think there's much point in dwelling on it.
But you're kind of perpetuating the assumption behind your question by not asking what we're up to nowadays.
I'll tell you anyway. ;)
Danielle has been doing a lot of hosting (The Dish) while going to college, and is now doing an MSN show called Last Night on TV: http://tv.msn.com/last-night-on-tv/ She's on twitter here: https://twitter.com/daniellefishel
Ben went to Stanford and is now doing indie films and writing. He is also on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BenSavage
Will is the king of voice over work. Currently, he's Lion-o on Thundercats (he's also writing for the show).
I'm having dinner with Danielle tonight. Maybe we'll post a photograph.

Assuming this is Danielle because of her tweet.

DanielleFishel 5 points 10 minutes ago

Okay, got a lot of requests for this from twitter! Rider and I are going to start a thread together later but for now, I thought I'd answer these questions.

1. I dated Matthew Lawrence for a little bit when we worked together but other than that, we all felt like family. I did have a crush on every single one of those boys at one time or another though. How could I not?!

2. Honestly no one was an asshole. Even all of the guest stars we had were fun, cool, easy to get along with people. If there was any ""asshole drama,"" I wasn't aware of it.

3. I don't know for sure but I think they just wanted to get away from the classic nerdy character thing we had going. Topanga also became more and more mainstream as time went by.

4. Rider and Ben were always good friends. Watching them act in scenes together is one of my favorite memories. Seeing them put together the boy band dance they used to do every week for the live audience was even better! ""Backstreets back, alright!!"" I laugh just thinking about it.

5. I don't think my career has suffered, per se. I wouldn't have a career w/o BMW and Topanga so I won't ever complain. Do I think it's hard for people to accept us as anything other than the roles we played on the show? Yes. But I'm just happy people even care after all these years. :)

P.S. Make sure you follow Rider on twitter (@onthestorm). He is incredibly smart, talented, and funny. The work he is doing now (writing, directing) is exceptional and he also has amazing book recommendations. Click on his links when he posts them...check out what he's doing now. You'll be happy to know that it's just as awesome as what he did on BMW."

**ORIGINAL VIDEO OF THE BEATING, WARNING IF YOU ARE SQUEAMISH:**  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl9y3SIPt7o

**There will be a live video AMA this evening on Vokle at 7 central time.  Thursday, December 1st, 7 central, 8 eastern.**  http://www.vokle.com/series/19652-hillary-adams

Reddit was the reason my mother and I actually have ground to stand on now, because no one ever believed us before the video was made public.  No one believed my father was such a person.  He was so perfect on the outside.

I've gotten messages from literally all over the world, Germany, Costa Rica, Netherlands, Australia, France, Mexico, the UK...  I had no idea it was such a global issue, that so many people were being hurt in their own homes.  I guess nobody really knows how to talk about it, since we're all badgered by our own respective situations into remaining quiet.  Well, that silence has been broken, and now a lot of people are speaking out about their own experiences with abusive parents.  Today I'm here to share my own story with you guys.

Thirty days ago, I was watching open-mouthed as the video's link climbed up to front page.  Reddit, thank you for saving not only me and my mother, but many other people out there who may not know what they're dealing with at home.

And now, I will get some basic questions out of the way to make room for the more unique questions I'm sure you Redditors can come up with.

Prologue:

There was barely a motive except for being frustrated at Dad's harassment over text messaging to both myself and my mother.  My mother would call me and cry, helpless and angry at his manipulation through my little sister.  I was sick of it.

A little over a year ago, Dad insisted on buying me a used Mercedes (I originally asked for a Mazda, but I went along with his idea because holy soap on a rope, a Mercedes!), and then yelled at me whenever I used it to transport anyone other than myself.  The agreement was that I was to return to college, and when I missed deadlines (my fault entirely), he told me to either purchase the car from him or return it and he'd release my school savings to me.  I told him ""speak of the devil, I'm waiting on a callback for a better job"".

Later that day, ""I got the job!  I can pay you for the car!""  Then suddenly, he wouldn't allow me to buy it and called me an ""insulting ingrate"", because I'd dared earlier to reach out to friends on twitter about his treatment of me and my mother.  He couldn't stand that I found a solution and was even more upset that I'd said a few words suggesting he was not perfect, and set me up for failure by demanding the car back and stranding me without a vehicle in the spread-out San Antonio, Texas, so there was barely any reliable way I could hold a job or go to college now.

I was so frustrated by his behavior that I uploaded the video privately and showed Mom, who burst out crying and didn't stop apologizing to me for three days.  She'd known the video existed since Spring, but had not watched it.  I told her I was thinking of publishing it.  She was afraid of what would happen and didn't encourage me nor hold me back.  After sleeping on it, Dad started harassing me about the car again, demanding it be returned.  I finally said ""do that and I release a video to the public of you beating the shit out of me"".

His response?  ""Do that if it will make you feel better.  You were never spanked but obviously should have been.""

**Q:  Why not solve it in private rather than going to the internet?**
A:  Dad was a County Court-At-Law Judge.  This meant he reigned over the county police, the entire courthouse, and different positions in town like the schoolboard.  He was the perfect citizen.  People swooned over him.  He won every election unopposed, and the two times he did have an opponent, he won by a landslide.  During the divorce when Mom felt threatened enough to call the police, Dad would talk to them and they'd mysteriously leave.  She tried talking to a counselor, but Dad had filled him in beforehand on the ""correct"" way to treat her complaints.  Whenever I tried to say I needed help and was being treated horrifically at home, people would scoff and tell me what a wonderful father I had.  THERE WAS NO WAY TO SOLVE IT PRIVATELY, because Dad would squash any outreach.  He controlled the community.  Anyone remotely employed with the government who knew how he really operated was scared to death to come forward, because he could have them fired.  He even threatened my little sister's school counselor's job if she said anything suggesting abuse during sessions.  I even called CPS days before the video went up and asked how to get a kid away from a severely manipulative and emotionally abusive parent, and I got fed a big ream of red tape.  Everything was useless.  He had always been winning and it wasn't changing.

My father once told me that the media could be considered like another branch of the law system, in a different sort of way, because they keep tabs on all kinds of other people.  I remembered this.  If the law was his turf, then the internet was mine.  And if the internet could keep tabs on the law, then...

I anonymously posted the video to /pol/, not saying I had anything to do with it.  When anons became outraged and demanded to know what was going on, I revealed that it was me.  They encouraged me to make the video's youtube link public.  So I did, and comments started appearing.  That's when the fire bit me and I posted it to Reddit.

**Q:  So your motive was...**
A:  To shock Dad into changing.  I wanted him to see that there were a number of people who were saying this was wrong.  It was wrong what he did.  I wanted him to see it and the comments and be horrified and apologize.  I wanted to turn a mirror on him.  Instead, he still believes he did nothing bad, as evidenced in this statement:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye2UeLBGnlk

**Q:  But wait!  He says you were caught stealing!**
A:  I used KaZaA to download video game music and terrible AMVs.  All he knew was that something was potentially illegal.  I was one of the best kids in town, my friends and I didn't stay out late, we didn't cause trouble, we didn't know what drugs and alcohol even were.  We didn't even litter.  Our idea of a fun time was going to a movie and Walmart.  So any tiny thing that I did that could even be perceived as wrong was blown out of proportion.

**Q:  He also says you weren't hurt.**
A:  Pfffffthahahahaha, I showed him the bruises all up and down my legs the day after the incident, and told him it hurt to walk.  He looked at me with his own two eyes and told me ""good"".  It is a preposterous lie that I wasn't hurt and I'm upset he would say such a thing.  He also lied through his teeth in the statement he released to the public, in which he said he was the ""primary"" support for me after I was out of the house, which is frankly a load of bullshit.  I work and my boyfriend works.  We pay our own bills, and we always have.  The only things my father paid for was my car and my phone, so he had control over my transportation and communication.  The perfect puppet strings.

**Q:  Why have you forgiven your mother and not your father?**
A:  Mom and I have always been best friends, and always were able to work through things, even if we squabbled.  We spent so much time together.  She gave up her career to raise me, a special needs baby, and guided me into college classes at age 15, and scholarships like the Coca-Cola Scholarship.  Without her I don't know if I'd be this far.  When I showed her the video, she was horrified.  She was broken.  She cried and stammered apologies to me for three days.  When Dad saw the video, he didn't think anything of it.

My grandmother once said a long time ago that it would take the entire world to get my father to change...  Now we have it, and it's still proving to be difficult...  It's so hard to stick to my guns of wanting to offer him help and counseling, because the more he withdraws and refuses to apologize, the more upset I am becoming.  I still need counseling myself.

No one at all should have to understand abuse or how it works, but unfortunately it's something that should be researched and taught, so we know how to protect ourselves.  Please, if you have never been manipulated or abused, think about inflammatory comments very carefully.  There are lots of people out there who share this unfortunate boat and it won't help a thing to make light of it.  Research battered wives, Stockholm Syndrome, narcissism, psychopathy, and the cycle of abuse that keeps people locked in.  It's frightening and absolutely anyone 100% can fall into it under the right circumstances.  Don't feed that line of ""I would have just walked away"".  **No, you wouldn't have.**  I apologize for being crass.  This is a serious subject.  Hopefully we can together approach it with tact and friendliness.

Alrighty, I think I got the main questions out of the way already.  I know it's a wall of text, but it's so difficult to condense...  Hopefully you guys will come up with some more creative questions instead!!

I really hope you'll join me tomorrow evening for the video broadcast!  :3  I want to talk about experience with the media and what Dr. Phil was like and all that.

But most of all, thank you, Reddit.  You guys saved me and my mother, and you saved countless other people out there too.  I myself had no idea that video was so bad until you guys and /pol/ told me.  Thank you.

To answer the questions that were in the request thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11k29d/ama_request_a_father_who_found_their_daughter_on/

1. When my parents found out, they confronted me and were PIIIIISSED! They pretty much disowned me and told me that they were ashamed to have me as their daughter.

2. They did confront me. See above.

3. They did not tell the family members. They don't want anyone to know. My dad is really high up in the company he works for (Regional Vice President of the company)

4. They were so angry. But its been roughly 6 months or more since they found out and they're pretty cool with it. They still HATE it and harass me for it sometimes but its whatever. They love me now.

So reddit, AMA about what my parents did or anything about doing porn. :D

EDIT: well its 5:10 am here. I'm going to be playing some Guild Wars 2. Ask some more questions and I'll respond later!

**EDIT 3: 7:00pm EST 10/16** So to answer a few questions that everyone has asked... My parents and I are on the same page now. We're on good terms. We kind of swept this under the rug and pretend it doesn't exist. It does come up from time to time but we kind of laugh about it. My mom has told me that she has seen my stuff and she must admit that I am good at what I do, but she does not like what I do. She thinks I should use my talents for better things.

Hi everyone. First let me introduce myself. My name is Kevin Moore and for roughly 12 years I have created adult movies for a living. 

I am going to be very honest with you all, this is my first post on reddit, so go easy on me. 

I am not exactly sure the best way to prove who I say I am, but here is some background links.

What exactly do I do?
I shoot both stills and video, as well as edit for a living. I have also performed in many scenes. I am lucky enough to now be an Evil Angel director and be part of that upper tier. 

What is your background?
I am 40 years old and did not make the plunge full time into doing this until 2000. Prior to that I grew up in Western Massachusetts. I was a UNIX SysAdmin for the UMASS campus in Amherst, where I was very active in the 90's running a series of Quake Servers and Counter Strike Servers called Yoda's Barn. I was also active on the SomethingAwful Forums (username: darkpriest) and the Offtopic Forums (username: dv8). Though my life is fairly hectic now, I will always be very much into and a fan of video games. 

Somewhat ironically this earlier comment on Reddit references a thread I have done on SA talking about my time in the industry: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/di6sy/as_requested_i_used_to_shoot_porn_ama/c10ee59

How exactly did you get into this?
I can partially thank Mitt Romey. Somewhat long story, but let me explain... I used to work an adult shop when I was 18 and always had an interest in porn and sex. That began my first insight into the industry from a video stores perspective. I learned a little bit about the business, however it wasn't until the mid 90's that I began really pursing it. I was very lucky to be at a major college (UMASS) right when the Internet was really starting to blossom. I jumped head first into it and when a company called iBill began allowing third party processing for credit card payments, I tried to start an amateur adult site around my girlfriend at the time. I did this out of my dorm room. 

I eventually moved into a full time career at UMASS working as a junior SysAdmin, but on the side still ran my amateur sites. I also began attending CES and would slip away to the adult section and try to make inroads to people there from all the various companies that produce adult movies. I also began shooting female performers while they were on tour at strip clubs in the New England area. I would shoot photos of them at the club for various little magazines like Xcitement or whomever would buy them. 

Mitt Romney became the Governor of Massachusetts and he gut funding to public education. Since UMASS was a state school, it had major budget cuts. In order to save people from layoffs, the union worked out a deal where employees could take a voluntary layoff, which included a small package to take care of you. I knew that my life was at a crossroads. I could stay at Umass and weather the storm or I could take a huge risk and due the voluntary layoff, use that money to relocate to LA and pursue shooting adult full time. I chose the layoff and moved to LA. 

My initial time in LA was at first very rough. Luckily I had made some good contacts by this point, but it is an expensive city to live in. I had gotten a gig at the trade publication for the adult industry (AVN) doing photos of events, tradeshows and performers on tour. I had a chance meeting with Joey Silvera, who is somewhat an icon in the industry. He was a long time performer in the 70's and 80's. He was now a producer/director at Evil Angel. Joey and I kind of hit it off. His assistant the time quit and he needed another assistant. He asked me if I wanted to do it and I started working for him. That really began the day to day shooting and working in the trenches. 

I learned so much from Joey and I spent many years working for him. From Joey I met John Leslie and Rocco Siffredi and John Stagliano and began working at times for all of them. Eventually, after many years of working under them, I began to branch out on my own. I started shooting stills and movies for a wide variety of companies and the rest they say is history. Eventually I was offered by John Stagliano the chance to direct at Evil Angel and now I do that, while also producing content for other companies. My list of credits include: Evil Angel, Hustler, Jules Jordan, Brazzers, Smash, Pink Visual, Reality Junkies, Sweetheart Video, Sweetsinner Video and the list goes on.

What do you shoot with?
For photos I used to be a Nikon guy, do or die. However, when I first saw the Canon MarkII I realized that this might change things. It was a small financial burden, but I dropped all my Nikon gear and glass and reinvested in all Canon gear. I was using the MarkII heavily, but now use two MarkIII's and recently picked up the 1DX. I shoot both stills and video with these cameras. I no longer use video cameras. Prior to shooting with the DSLR's, I was using a solid state Sony EX3 camera. It is still a great video camera, but the quality you can get out of the current DSLR's is amazing. I use a wide variety of after market products to make shooting easier with DSRL's. 

Why do you do this?
That is a complicated question and if I were to get insightful I am sure it has to do somewhat with my upbringing and also my outlook. I was raised in a very serious irish catholic household. Sex was a massive taboo, however I never viewed girls as ""icky"" even at a very young age. The problem was that for a long time I couldn't come to terms with the way I was raised versus how I felt. It caused me incredible internal conflict and as Alec Baldwin once put it, being irish catholic is guilt upon crushing guilt. 

What I now know as an adult is that I feel very strongly that adults should be allowed to express themselves sexually with other consenting adults. Repression is a terrible thing. Porn to me is escapism entertainment. It is like people watching ""professional"" wrestling. Everyone knows its fake, yet people still love it Just like horror movies and other forms of entertainment it allows people to escape the stress of their life and for 15 minutes live out some sexual fantasy they probably will never experience. Sex isn't always rainbows and butterflies. Sometimes we use it to explore our own turmoil. I fully understand that it is not for everyone and not everyone views it the same as I. 

I realize this might have been extremely long, I appreciate you taking the time to read it and would love to answer any and all questions.

956,IAmA,AMA Request: Hans Zimmer,"This guy is absolutely amazing, he is truly a musical genius! German composer with such notable works as: The Lion King, The Thin Red Line, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Sherlock Holmes, Inception, and The Dark Knight.

1. How long does it usually take you to create a film's entire soundtrack?

2. What inspired you to make such unsettling music in The Dark Knight, and how did you do it?

3. You collaborated with James Newton Howard on The Dark Knight, and you're both known for your talent in the industry. Did you get along easily, or clash on a lot of issues for the film's music?

4. What's the most fun you've ever had while working on a soundtrack for a movie? Which movie?

5. Toughest question for you, I bet: What is the most beautiful instrument in your opinion? 

**edit:**
Did I forget to mention how awesome this guy is?

But seriously, Mr. Zimmer deserves this kind of attention. Too long has our idea of music been warped to believe it was anything other than the beauty he creates now. "

He has said he will get back to you though and I'll get him finishing off some of the questions that he was looking to answer tomorrow. Feel free to keep asking away as he is amazed at all of your interest in his life and wishes to read through each comment (much to my frustration). Thanks again guys, *cliché you're the best here*.

958,IAmA,I just went 96 hours without heroin for the first time in five years. AMA.,"(Throw away account, of course.)

Today marks the longest period of time I've gone without it since I started. Four years of snorting and smoking. I never fixed, not once. I don't like needles and never particularly wanted AIDS. Even at my lowest point, the idea of fixing skeeved me out.

I had the help of Prince Valium for the first couple days. That helped me sleep and maintain a bit of my sanity. 

The worst part, the part I was dreading most, rather, were the *super* intense muscle aches. It hurts down to your bones and makes you grit your teeth until you feel like they're coming loose. 

But those have since passed. My nose is still a little runny and I'm shitting like a fire hose. So basically it feels like I'm getting over a bout with the flu. I never puked or itched, two nasty things I was expecting.

I'm a little depressed. Nothing very serious. I went out today for the first time since Wednesday. I forgot how much more laborious everything is without smack, everything requires so much deliberation and patience. This is *absolutely not an endorsement*, but that's the one good thing about the shit: it makes you incredibly passive to life's minutiae. 

I find that I have to pump myself to do small things. Yesterday, I watched an hour of a movie I hated because I didn't want to get up and look for the remote. 

I've ""tried"" a few times in the past to kick smack. And, yes, those quotation marks imply sarcasm. Those attempts were ill-fated from the get-go.

Anyways, if you're curious or you're looking to kick it, ask me anything and I'll be as forthcoming as I can be. 

EDIT: Someone just sent me an anonymous subscription to Reddit gold. It's sort of hard to find words to how much that means to me. To know someone else is looking out for me even though I'm just a faceless username to them. That's big. Reddit is good people.

* Chick inmates are crazier than the dudes.
* I like Apples to Apples.

962,IAmA,[Modpost] Some changes regarding IAmA requests and comments,"TL;DR at the top: New rule on celebrity requests, and moderation of comments

1. **New Rule for Celebrity Requests**

For those of you who have never been to this subreddit before, we get a lot of requests for celebrities here. The problem with requests is that they just take up space from actual AMAs. They are tolerated because [they do sometimes lead to actual AMAs](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14vlg2/meta_should_there_be_a_separate_subreddit_for_ama/c7gtys2). There are three main ways that this happens. First, the celebrity is secretly a reddit user and sees the request (not that common). Second, someone who knows the celebrity sees the request and tells them about it (more common, but still rare). Third, users themselves contact the celebrity, informing them of /r/IAmA and that there is interest in hearing from them.

This 3rd reason is the reasoning behind the new rule. **From now on, any request for a celebrity must include a way to publicly contact them**. Their twitter page, their facebook page, the contact sheet from their website, whatever. Any way that our users can tell this person that we want an AMA from them. Requests that do not comply with this requirement will be deleted. If you cannot find a publicly available way to contact that celebrity, then do not post your request. 

This does **not** apply to requests for non-celebrities (example, ""AMA request: Joe Schmoe, lead designer of New Video Game), or requests for no one in particular (example, ""AMA request: a farmer""). It **only** applies to requests for celebrities. 

This does not change **anything** about Reddit's [rules on posting personal information](http://www.reddit.com/rules):

&gt; **NOT OK**: Posting a link to your friend's facebook profile.

&gt; **OK**: Posting your senator's publicly available contact information

&gt; **NOT OK**: Posting the full name, employer, or other real-life details of another redditor

&gt; **OK**: Posting a link to a public page maintained by a celebrity.

To clear things up, here are two requests: one in compliance with the rules, and one not:

[**Acceptable**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1au1bp/iama_request_jason_bateman/)

[**Unacceptable**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1au1dc/ama_request_jason_bateman/)

2. **Moderation of comments**

[Although the mods have implored our users to act respectfully and courteously](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/184yf5/mod_post_voting_guidelines_and_etiquette/), unfortunately that just isn't enough sometimes. In order to continually get good AMAs from people with interesting experiences, /r/IAmA needs to build a reputation as being different from other interviews where users can ask anything, but also as a place where people will be treated politely and actually listened to. In order to balance those two interests, the moderators **will be removing comments designed solely to harass, abuse, or threaten the OP**. This *absolutely* does not mean that you should not ask tough questions; only that you should do so civilly. From now on, something like ""Fuck you, OP"" will be removed, but ""OP, why did you do [something I disagree with]"" is perfectly fine. Slurs and other hate speech will be specifically targeted. From now on, **please** report any comment that just insults and harasses someone answering questions. 

We hope that both of these rules will bring about plenty of good AMAs from whoever the users want to hear from.

963,IAmA,"I have been in pain since I was born due to my skin condition, Epidermolysis bullosa. AMA","I was born with a rare skin condition called Epidermolysis bullosa, or EB for short. Its primary effect being the connective tissues between my epidermis and lower tissues is weakened or even non existent in some places. This causes blistering, which leads to permanent scarring over my body, which haven't stopped hurting since being inflicted. It also caused my teeth to lack enamel and my finger and toe nails to fall off over time.  There is currently no promising cure, but research is ongoing.

I am sorry for not being able to answer a lot of your questions but the internet in Egypt was blocked for the six past days, I really want to share what happened with us the past few days because the world knows nothing about the chaos in Egypt since last Friday.


I am deeply grateful for all your wishes and kindness in my last thread, although I've seen most of your comments just now, you guys made me feel that the police is still throwing us with tear bombs.

I am going to give you a live report on the last few days and hopefully I will answer all your questions along the way.

This started on Tuesday when I went to a protest for a democratic change in Egypt, I really can't claim I'm a political activist, I can just claim to be a normal Egyptian fed up with the corruption I see everyday, everywhere, affecting everybody.

I wouldn't consider myself poor, but I wouldn't consider myself rich either, but I would consider myself one of the privileged citizens in Egypt for having steady income, a car and living in a relatively high-class suburb.

I've slept on the street for the first time in my life on Tuesday 25 January, when more than 20K protestors stood in ""Al Tahreer"" square in Egypt protesting corruption in Egypt, it was one of the best days in my life, I've seen the true face of Egypt, there were people of all ages, sexes and classes in protests that day, I've seen the poor, the rich, the striving minority, Christians, Muslims, opposition and even Army men.

Moving on to Wednesday 26 January, I already provided details on my arrest, I was arrested at the protests and was released after 12 hours, in the dawn of the next day.

Thursday was kind of a slow day, I was at home recovering of my wounds from being beaten badly by the police, I wrote [my first AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f9zac/i_was_caught_and_brutally_tortured_in_the_recent/) here on reddit, to my amazement it jumped to the frontpage, I wasn't expecting near that kind of response but I thank you guys for that, apart from some tear bombs being thrown by the police not much action that day, apart from reddit action of course. Facebook, twitter, Aljazeera, BBC, and a couple of other sites were blocked Thursday night.

The big event was on Friday at noon, and I note that by then Egypt has been thrown into complete solitary confinement, everything was cut down; the internet, mobile signal, Messaging services and even some landlines.

I walked nearly 50 Kms that day, thinking of it I can say that I've walked in the past week further than what I've walked in my entire life.

I walked from one suburb to the other, the protest was getting more people every minute, we reached the point where I couldn't see the beginning or the end of the march from an elevated position, it was a huge march but it was only one of tens or hundreds of similar marches in Cairo that day.

Near downtown it was obvious that there was an intense presence of police forces and when we reached the suburb of ""Attaba"" the police forces became unbelievably violent, they were throwing tens of tear bombs at the crowds and children were suffocating, I carried a trapped girl on my shoulders while running and vomiting heavily because of the tear gas being everywhere, I was shot a couple of times by rubber bullets but kept on running, I actually thought they were shooting live rounds and judging by my last encounter with them I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

As I said before there wasn't much resentment towards the US in Egypt apart from supporting Mubarak's dictatorship, but once some people pointed out the ""Made in the U.S."" Mark on the tear bomb cans everyone entered a deep state of anger towards both America and Mubarak's regime.

Soon we learned that not only ""Attaba"" was viciously attacked by the police but everywhere else, and from being there I can testify that the police started the violence in what I have seen myself to be a peaceful march.

Later that day the violence escalated and we were treating the police as our enemies -and they have proven to be so- and Mubarak's arrogant speech got everyone more provoked.

At night we saw the Egyptian heavy artillery roaming the streets, and I'm noting here that Egyptians love their army to death, although no public demands have been answered or met we were happy to see the Army and considered that to be a phenomenal gain.

As the army's presence increased the Police were escaping the protestors' violence -which the police initiated and provoked- and after the burning down of most police stations all the criminals escaped -some claim by the police themselves- and Cairo had thousands of thugs and criminals on the streets and a complete absence of police forces, I see that as a major treachery from the police, please contact me with what I should do if you happen to know any legal actions that should be done, I will leave you guys for a couple of hours I have to go get me some food and when I'm back I will post details about my life after the police vanished from Cairo and answer all your questions.

Edit: Continuing

I must note a couple of random things, On Friday I got shot by rubber bullets and another kind of bullets that splits mid-air into hundreds of metal pieces and hurts a lot on impact, I saw death twenty feet away, I felt scared like I have never felt before in my life, I saw a building collapsing in front of my eyes and my respiratory system now runs on oxygen and tear gas.

Later that day I heard of thugs being released into the streets and I was terrified for my family, I went home to find people gathered and taking shifts to guard our neighborhood, I took place at the top of a 15-story building as a lookout for thugs that come in groups armed with AK47s and pistols stolen from the police stations, I stood in place till dawn and I saw an army vehicle opening fire on one of these armed mobs a couple of blocks away, it was terrifying and some of my neighbors nearly opened fire a couple of times on individual thugs.

Saturday and Sunday were the worst, due to the absence of the police force a couple of prisons were attacked and a lot of convicts got away, I heard a lot of bullets being fired that day, a couple of armed thugs were arrested downtown and proven to be police officers, which increased the state of hatred we all felt towards them.

I was a ground trooper the next few days, I got my ancient air-gun out and took shifts walking down the streets, I was given a walkie-talkie and was in touch with the neighborhood leader, a couple of thugs threw molotov cocktails on our cars and fired a couple of rounds but were arrested and handed to the army.

Till this hour we still have guarding shifts and mine starts in about 5 hours, I just want to note that we took care of our neighborhood better than the police ever did, people were out handing us food and drinks and blankets, I feel proud of every Egyptian that took responsibility these couple of days but a couple of questions are still unanswered: Should we let the police take control of the streets again despite their obvious treason to us Egyptians? What can I do to help in punishing those officers responsible for beating me up? 

**Important note:** As I said there were a lot of Christians in the protests, the protests were not dominated by any political party nor is this by any means an Islamic revolution as the stupid ""Fox News"" is trying to make it appear, these protests were purely political and social and not religious.

**Flickr:** [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/59057377@N07/sets/72157625960891810/) you will find every picture I took, photos from the past week will be added, when they arrested me they confiscated my memory card so unfortunately not all the pictures are with me, I'll upload what I can. 

**Important edit: Help! Some of my friends just called to let me know they released hundreds of thugs downtown Cairo under the guidance of police officers and intelligence agents with the sole purpose of infiltrating the protests and lots of protesters were killed, I'm in shock right now and I feel so helpless, PLEASE HELP.**

**3:** You've got an amazing outlook on life. If you had gone down the route of a normal, traditional, all-American lifestyle, where do you think you'd be?

989,IAmA,"I am a teacher in a severely impoverished school district, and struggle with the failing education system in our country first hand. AMA","I work as a teacher in North Carolina, in a county that has a per capita income that is less than $15,000.  The school has an 87% free or reduced lunch rate for the students who attend."
990,IAmA,"Left my DoD Counterterrorism Analysis job, took on $87,932 in debt, and put my Harvard degree to use writing a book about how the social and economic inequalities created by the War on Drugs will be the most likely cause of terrorism. Had an agent for a bit but now it’s up online for free, AMA","So after enough time writing up reports that went directly into an electronic black hole I figured I was too young to feel like I was wasting my life stuck behind a desk. [Now the book I wrote is up on the internet totally for free](http://tremblethedevil.com/?page_id=1131).

Maybe I just took *Fight Club* a little too seriously. 

But I decided to leave the DoD to write a colloquial and accessible book about terrorism, I'd studied Government while in college, getting Harvard's equivalent of a minor in Arabic and taking as many classes about the Middle Eastern history and Islamic politics as I could - what's happening now in the Middle East is pretty much exactly what I studied, what'll happen when democracy finally comes along and sweeps across the region. So after doing the query letter thing I managed to [land myself an agent](http://i.imgur.com/aUzu9.jpg) who seemed pretty awesome.  And then the literary industry began to collapse, and then the economy tanked. So we amicably parted ways and I set off on my own.

At that point I begin to seriously question my decision to leave my desk job and [take on $87,932 of debt](http://i.imgur.com/rYWPh.jpg) to try and get what I thought was an important message out there, and also be able to keep coaching high school sports year-round.

Coaching has been an invaluable way of getting in touch with exactly where our upcoming generation is at in terms of race relations and values - I've coached both welfare kids and some of the wealthiest and notoriously privileged private school kids in the country. 

After being loosely affiliated with a couple social media companies, I decided to just go ahead and [throw the entire thing up online where you can read it for free](http://tremblethedevil.com/?page_id=1131). If you want to get an idea of what it's like, [this post is a general overview of my take on terrorism](http://tremblethedevil.com/?p=12), and [this one gets into specifics about just how damaging the War on Drugs has been](http://tremblethedevil.com/?p=2310).

In the same way that you can go into a bookstore and browse as long as you'd like or listen to just about anything online totally for free, but to really take something with you, you have to pay for that convenience - if you'd like to keep reading offline [you can buy an e-copy of the book for your Kindle or Nook](http://tremblethedevil.com/?p=1307), or get [a physical copy of it](https://www.createspace.com/3631725).

All that said - ask me anything!!"

992,IAmA,"IAM a seven-time New York Times bestselling author (Neil Strauss), AMA.","I saw there were a couple requests for AMAs with me, so thought Valentines Day would be appropriate. For those who didn't' request, I am a formerly forever-alone Rolling Stone (and former New York Times) journalist who went undercover in the seduction community, and somehow ended up as the international spokesperson for pickup artists after writing The Game.

Proof that this is me is posted on: www.facebook.com/neilstrauss and www.neilstrauss.com

I assume there are going to be a lot of questions, especially about pickup, so I've asked a couple friends to help answer a few so I can keep up. Their usernames are: earcaraxe, rico81, and aaronfrankel.

UPDATE (2/15/12, 9:30 a.m.): This ended at 2 p.m. yesterday. For all the questions that came in afterward that I didn't get to answer, I will do another AMA in the future, so please repost them. If your question was NOT answered below and is URGENT, feel free to email me through the website (url above), identify yourself as a Redditor, and I will get you your answer.

I've been referred to as the 'most fiscally conservative Governor' in the country, and vetoed so many bills during my tenure that I earned the nickname ""Governor Veto."" I bring a distinctly business-like mentality to governing, and believe that decisions should be made based on cost-benefit analysis rather than strict ideology.

Before my accident i was athletic and did not play very many video games. However, recovering in the hospital there was alot of down time. Somehow i got the idea to use a strap given to me by occupational therapists used the hold a fork, i flipped it upside down, stuck a pencil in it and started learning to type. I then bought a simple trackball mouse. I began with simple games and inevitably started on my way to becoming featured on Counter Logic gaming and own3d.tv.

999,IAmA,Six years ago my wife and I sold everything and bought a 90ft tunnel oven to make cookies. We're now shipping between 1 and 4 thousand pounds per week.  AMA,"I'm a business owner and entrepreneur and I haven't worked for someone else since I was 19. I'm doing this AMA so that I can answer any questions you may have about being in business or starting your own company.  The cookie business wasn't my first, nor most successful but it is the one I'm proudest of. Some background:

My adventures started when I was 6 with my own Fire Department in Cleveland, I would pull my red wagon up and down the street with a step ladder, fire extinguisher and garden hose looking for fire (until I got discouraged &amp; spent my time building forts). At 9 I ran a multi-route, paper route and hired other kids to deliver for me. By 19 I was eager to ""begin life"" and I dropped out of Bradley University in Peoria. Shortly after that I started my first ""real business"": it was a burglar alarm for apartments. I developed &amp; manufactured the product and sold them by hiring an off-duty detective from the local police force to give “security presentations” in luxury apartment buildings. We would use the party room, he would present statistics, speak about crime and the responsibility of protecting property and I would give a product demonstration and collect orders. A friend would go the next day and install the alarms. This worked out well as I had low overhead &amp; was making a good income.

Some amount of “beginners luck” helped me along the way, the first product that I ever developed with the intention of mass producing was chosen as one of the 100 most important products developed in the world the year that I developed it. This was in 1977, back in the “mechanical” age. Since then, I've developed impact recorders, mechanical accelerometers, temperature recorders to monitor the shipment of perishables, and a widely employed derailment detector to stop subway derailments before they become catastrophic. 

Currently I run a business that employs 30-40 people and we produce everything ""in-house"" near Los Angeles. We are selling high quality dog treat &amp; nutritional supplements in about 2,500-3,000 stores nationwide, a disposable poop scooper (we produce about 20 million annually) and the best chocolate chip cookies you'll ever eat which I started because I missed the 70's style cookies that made the original Famous Amos a Los Angeles sensation. My cookies are currently being sold in about 200 stores and we're shipping anywhere between 1,000 and 4,000 lbs per week.

Not directly business related but things you may find interesting. I was on “[What’s my Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What's_My_Line%3F)” and got to hang out with [Soupy Sales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soupy_Sales) for an hour, I inspired a front page article in the New York Times regarding corruption and I've coached entrepreneurs &amp; spoken to groups when invited. I’ve been very fortunate in life &amp; see my overall purpose as propagating happiness through my cookies &amp; being of service to others, if I can contribute anything here feel free to ask. 

I've been very impressed with Reddit and the community and this inspired me to do an ""AMA"".  Hope you find it useful.
